<h2>I</h2>
<h3>A STRANGER AND A PROMISE</h3>
</div>
<p>The rabbit bounded away and was lost in
the underbrush. Steve stood looking disgustedly
after him, a limp figure, one
shoulder dropping until the old knit suspender fell at
his side, and a sullen, discouraged look settling in his
brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo; no hunter noways. Peers lack I don&rsquo;t
even know &rsquo;nough to ketch a rabbit,&rdquo; he said with
scorn. &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s that lazy Tige anyways?&rdquo; he
added, his scorn merging into wrath.</p>
<p>Then jerking the old suspender in place he straightened
up on his sturdy, bare feet, and darted through
the underbrush in the direction where the rabbit had
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ketch you yit, yes I will, you same old cottontail,&rdquo;
he muttered through clenched teeth.</p>
<p>There it was again! Just a moment the round,
gray back darted above the bushes, and then plunging
into deeper undergrowth, bounded on and on.
But the slim, knotty brown legs plunged on and on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
too, till at last a swift, cruel stone felled the unlucky
little woodlander, for Steve was a most skillful marksman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! thought you&rsquo;d git away from me, did ye?&rdquo;
said the boy, picking up the still body. &ldquo;I reckons
I kin do some things yit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ef I don&rsquo;t know
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was in a strange, new mood. He did not
understand himself. Though a good hunter for a lad
of twelve he had been heretofore a generous friend
or conqueror of the fur and feathered folk, wont to
deal gently with a fallen foe. Now he jerked up the
limp body of the rabbit savagely and struck its head
spitefully against a near-by tree trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kin kill rabbits ef I can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a big black and tan dog came into
view with the dignity befitting age. Boy and dog
had been born the same month, but while one was
scarcely well entered upon life, the other&rsquo;s race was
almost run. The boy was usually most considerate
of the infirmities of his lifelong friend, but to-day
he scolded the dog till with drooping tail and
grieved, uncomprehending eyes he slunk away out
of sight.</p>
<p>A strange experience had come to the mountain
boy the day before which had changed his whole
world. It was as though the wooded mountains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
which hemmed in his little cabin home had parted
for a moment and given him a glimpse of a fascinating
world beyond. He and Tige had wandered
farther from home that day than ever before, though
wanderers they had always been, the woods holding
a deep interest for Steve. He loved to hide in the
densest solitudes, lie still with his dog and dream,
fantastic, unreal dreams. Now a definite, tangible
vision had come to him out of the solitude of a hazy
November day in the mountains of Kentucky. He
had lain for two hours or more in the stillness when
suddenly Tige lifted his head and gave a sharp bark,
then came the sound of voices, strange voices Steve
at once knew them to be, and as he caught the tones
more clearly, recognized that one at least was of a
kind which he had never heard before. Keeping
Tige quiet with a firm hand, he lifted his head and
listened with ear and soul, then into view stepped a
man of medium height with a clean, fine face, clothes
of a sort unknown to the boy, and an easy, alert
stride totally foreign to the mountaineer&rsquo;s slouching
gait. A mountain man accompanied him, but he
too was a stranger to the boy.</p>
<p>The man of the new, strange species smiled at the
boy&rsquo;s gaping mouth and wonder-wide eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, son,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, &ldquo;are you a sportsman
too?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>The quick, clear, cultured voice, the unfamiliar accent
was so utterly foreign to anything the boy had
ever heard that he could not take in the import of the
words, and amazed silence was his only reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; drawled the mountain guide, &ldquo;who&rsquo;d er
thought er seein&rsquo; a chap lack that heah? Whar&rsquo;d
you come from anyways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was familiar vernacular, and Steve, rising
slowly from the ground, and allowing Tige to make
friendly acquaintance with the strangers, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lives at Hollow Hut and I comes over here
whenever I pleases. Whar&rsquo;d you uns come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man gave a hearty but musical laugh at the
ready dignity of the reply, but the boy&rsquo;s mouth
dropped once more in consternation, as words came
again in crisp, foreign accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came from the city, my lad, to get some of
your fine quail and deer. You are willing I should
have a few, are you not? My friend here is showing
me the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain folk had proved a most entertaining
study for this sportsman, and his interest was ready
for each new specimen encountered. Turning to the
guide he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we lunch here,&rdquo; and taking out his
watch continued, &ldquo;yes, it is high time; twelve thirty
to the minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>The boy stepped forward involuntarily for a look
at the queer, pretty thing in the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a watch, son. Didn&rsquo;t you ever see
one?&rdquo; said the man kindly.</p>
<p>The guide smiled derisively: &ldquo;Wal, I reckons
not,&rdquo; while the boy, too interested for reply, asked
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a watch?&rdquo; and the man with his genial
laugh said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, we will be greatly pleased if you will take
lunch with us. My name is Polk, Samuel Polk,&rdquo; he
said, touching his cap with the unfailing courtesy of
a true gentleman. &ldquo;And after we eat I will show
you the watch and tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the mountaineer does not readily eat with
&ldquo;furriners,&rdquo; so Steve stood near by and looked on
while the two men ate very strange things. Little
cans were opened and tiny fish taken out that looked
exceedingly queer. Mr. Polk, trying to persuade the
boy to eat, explained that these were sardines, some
square, white things were crackers, a thick stuff was
cheese and that some big, round, yellow things were
oranges. But Steve only stared in silence till the meal
was over though Tige, with no instinctive handicap,
accepted delicious scraps with astonishment and relish.</p>
<p>So amazed, however, had the boy been with it all that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
he nearly forgot about the watch. But when he remembered
and the man let him take it in his rusty,
brown fingers, that was the most wonderful moment
of all. The tick, tick inside was a marvel, almost a
thing uncanny to the boy, and when it was explained
how the hands went round and round, telling the
time of day, it surely seemed a thing beyond mortal
ken.</p>
<p>The guide drawled out with a superior air: &ldquo;Wal,
sonny, you come from the backwoods shore ef you
never heerd tell of a watch before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked squarely at him in sullen resentment
a moment, but with such opportunity at hand
he wouldn&rsquo;t waste time with the likes of him. He
asked, &ldquo;What moves them things round?&rdquo; and the
man kindly opened the watch at the back and displayed
all the cunning wheels which respond to the
loosening spring, explained how it was wound each
day to keep it from running down, and in answer to
the boy&rsquo;s eager questions as to how such things were
made told him something of watch manufacture.</p>
<p>At last the wonderful hour was over and the two
strange men prepared to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, son,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;one of these
days you will leave the mountains and go out into
the big world to live a life of usefulness and honour,
I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>The words, so simple and commonplace to the
man, were to the boy like a telescope lifted to the
unknown heavens, but through which he could not
yet look. He watched the men go down the mountainside,
the strange words which he did not comprehend,
but was never to forget, ringing in his ears.
A bit of heavy timber hid them at last, and the boy
stood dejected a moment, his heart swelling with an
agony of strange longing, while the dog looked up
at him almost pleading to understand. Then suddenly,
with a cry of hope, Steve sprang after them,
the dog following. Breathless he came upon them,
and the man turned in surprise at the tragic voice
and face. When the boy could speak he panted out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the bes&rsquo; fox skin anywheres hereabout.
I&rsquo;ll swap it with you uns fer that watch thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man suppressed a smile and kindly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, lad, I couldn&rsquo;t do without it for the rest of
this hunting trip, but I tell you what I will do.
When I get back to the city I&rsquo;ll send you one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ef yer&rsquo;ll come home with me I&rsquo;ll give ye
the fox skin now,&rdquo; the boy responded promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind about the fox skin now; I must
get back to camp before dark and we are many miles
away,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t take the watch &rsquo;thout you git the
skin,&rdquo; said the boy sturdily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the man, realizing
that he had struck the stubborn, independent pride
of a mountaineer. &ldquo;You give me your name, tell
me where you live and I&rsquo;ll send you the watch; then
next time I&rsquo;m over here I&rsquo;ll get the skin.&rdquo; The address
was a difficult matter to determine, but the
mountaineer helped them out.</p>
<p>This satisfied the boy and he saw the two strangers
depart with better spirit, since he could look forward
to the coming of the watch. He did not understand
how it would ever reach him, but trusted the
stranger implicitly. When the last sound of departing
feet among the underbrush had died away, Steve
turned and went home with long, rapid strides, the
dog recognizing the relief and following with wagging
tail.</p>
<p>He found supper on the table, the savoury bacon
and hoe-cake greeting him from the door. The head
of the family, lean, lank and brown, was already
transporting huge mouthfuls from the tin platter to
his mouth; the fat, slovenly daughter sat for a moment
to rest and cool her face before beginning to
eat, while the mother still occupied a chimney corner,
pipe in mouth, for she &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t wanted nothin&rsquo; to eat
lately, her stomick seemed off the hooks somehow.&rdquo;
These, with the boy, composed the family, a row of
graves out under the trees at the back of the hut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
filling the long gap between Mirandy, a young woman
of twenty-one, and Steve. The boy sat down, but
before he ate that remarkable tale of his morning experience
had to be told. When he was done the
father said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh, better let city folks alone; don&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo;
to do with none of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, feeling the rebuke, then turned to his
supper, but when his father had gone out to smoke,
and Mirandy was in the lane looking for her sweetheart,
Steve stole up to his mother&rsquo;s side and stood
digging his toe in the sand hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mammy,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;what makes that man
diffrunt from we uns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman smoked a moment in silence and
then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, there&rsquo;s a heap over the mountains what
makes him diffrunt,&ndash;&ndash;things we ain&rsquo; never seen ner
heern tell on.&rdquo; She smoked again a puff or two,
then added, &ldquo;I recken schoolin&rsquo;s the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s schoolin&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larnin&rsquo; things,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>The subject of schools had never been discussed in
the boy&rsquo;s hearing. His father didn&rsquo;t believe in them,
there wasn&rsquo;t a book, not even a Bible, in all the scattered
little remote mountain community, and if the
boy had ever heard either books or schools mentioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
before the words had made no impression on
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they larn to make watch things thar?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>His mother said she supposed so, &ldquo;she knew they
larned out o&rsquo; things they called books,&rdquo; and then she
explained as best she could to him what schools and
books were. When his father came in again Steve
said boldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pappy, I&rsquo;m er goin&rsquo; over the mountains an&rsquo; larn
how to make them watch things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountaineer stood as if paralyzed a moment,
then his dull eyes blazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t nuther! Not a step will ye go!
Ye shan&rsquo;t nuver hev nothin&rsquo; to do with no city folks,
so help me God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy dropped back cowed and trembling; he
had never seen his father so stirred. He didn&rsquo;t dare
ask a question, but when the mountaineer had seated
himself in the chimney corner opposite his wife, he
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;City folks with all their larnin&rsquo;, fine clothes an&rsquo;
fine ways ain&rsquo;t to be depended on. I wouldn&rsquo;t trus&rsquo;
one of &rsquo;em with a jay bird lessen I wanted to git shed
of it. Don&rsquo;t you let me hear no mo&rsquo; o&rsquo; your goin&rsquo;
over the mountains arter city folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prejudice of some mountaineers against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
city is deep-seated. They have little use for the
&ldquo;settlements,&rdquo; meaning the smaller towns, but the
city is their abomination. Jim Langly&rsquo;s prejudice
was even stronger than that of the average mountain
man of this type, for it had been a matter of contention
between himself and his wife in the early days
of their married life. She had always longed to see
what was beyond the mountains and besieged him to
go till the subject could no more be mentioned between
them.</p>
<p>Steve soon climbed to his bed in a corner of the
room with a very heavy heart. If city folks weren&rsquo;t
to be depended on then he would never get that
watch, and all the beautiful visions of learning to do
things in a wonderful new world grew dim and uncertain.
So heavy was his heart as he fell asleep
that when he waked at daylight, it was with a terrible
sense of loss and grief. The morning meal
over he wandered off with Tige, dull and dejected,
till the unlucky rabbit had crossed his path and
stirred strange, resentful enmity towards his little
familiar contestants of the woods. Sending the dog
angrily off he skinned the rabbit with savage jerks
and then carried it at once back to his home, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fry it, &rsquo;Randy, fry it dog-goned hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother caught the sullen, angry tone, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
when Mirandy went out in the kitchen to begin the
dinner, she called him from where he sat on the
door-step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, sonny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a rare term of endearment, and Steve got
up quickly and went to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think too much o&rsquo; whut ye pappy said
about city folks. He&rsquo;s allus hated &rsquo;em fer some reason,
I don&rsquo;t know whut, &rsquo;less hit was &rsquo;cause I saw one
when I was a gal afore we married, nuver min&rsquo; how
ner where, and arter that I allus wanted to see whut
was over the mountings. Ef ever ye git a chanct I
want ye ter go thar an&rsquo; larn ter do things. I&rsquo;d er
done hit ef I&rsquo;d er been a man. But don&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;
to ye pappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This caution was unnecessary; and what a change
the simple words made for Steve! His spirit
bounded up into the world of visions again, and
when dinner was on the table he refused to take a
mouthful of the savoury rabbit, so ashamed was he
of the manner of its killing.</p>
<p>After this his mind was constantly on the watch
which was to come. How it was to reach him he
did not think out, for the simple reason that he knew
nothing of the distance which stretched between him
and the city, nor of methods of communication. No
letter or piece of mail of any sort had ever come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
his home, or that of any one else of which he knew
but things of various sorts were gotten from the
crossroads store ten miles away, skillets and pans,
axes and hoes, which were made somewhere, and he
supposed some time when some one of the community
went to the store they&rsquo;d find his watch there.
But week after week went by till spring came on,
and nobody went to the store. The mountain folk
indeed had little need of stores. They spun and
wove the cloth for their clothes, raised their corn,
pigs, and tobacco, made their own &ldquo;sweetin&rsquo;,&rdquo; long
and short, meaning sugar and molasses, and distilled
their own whiskey. So the boy&rsquo;s heart grew heavy
again with the long delay and he began to think bitterly
that his father and not his mother was right,
when one day a stranger whom he had never seen
before drove up to the door.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>A PACKAGE BY MAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Howdye! Does airy feller named Stephen
Langly live here?&rdquo; said the stranger,
reining in his tired, raw-boned steed without
difficulty.</p>
<p>Mirandy went to the cabin door, stared a minute
in surprise and then shook her head slowly. But
Steve pushed past her saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thar is, too. I&rsquo;m Stephen Langly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! Sakes erlive, I clean forgot that was yo&rsquo;
name!&rdquo; and his sister laughed lazily, while the
stranger joined in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;re a powerful little chap to be a-gittin&rsquo;
mail. But this here thing has yo&rsquo; name on it, they
tole me at the store, an&rsquo; so I brung it along as I was
a-comin&rsquo; this-a-way. Hit&rsquo;s been thar mo&rsquo; than three
months they tole me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve took the package, his hands trembling with
eagerness and would have darted away to the woods
with his treasure where he might look upon it first
alone, but Mirandy stormed when he turned to go,
and the man said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears to me you mought show what ye got, when
I brung it all this long ways to ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That did seem the fair thing to do, so when they
had asked the man to &ldquo;light and hitch,&rdquo; Steve sat
down on the door-step and removed the wrappings
from the square box; there was tissue paper first, a
miracle of daintiness which the boy had never beheld
before, and at last the watch came to view. Steve
lifted it in trembling fingers, and while Mirandy and
the man expressed their admiration his first quivering
words were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That other one was yaller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, now,&rdquo; said Mirandy, &ldquo;that one was gold;
you couldn&rsquo;t expect that man to send you no gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mirandy, having a precious gilded trinket, was
better posted on the colour and value of metals than
Steve, though she made a slight error in her next
statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This hern is silver; that&rsquo;s the next thing to gold,&rdquo;
and the bright nickel of the Waterbury twinkled in
the spring sunshine as though trying to measure up
to its admirers&rsquo; estimate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A silver watch,&rdquo; said the stranger after he had
heard the story of that autumn day with its promise
of a watch which was just now fulfilled&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;wal, you
air a lucky boy, shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Langly called feebly from within, and Steve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
went and laid it on the bed beside her. Her
&ldquo;stomick had never seemed to get on the hooks,&rdquo;
as she expressed it, all winter; her spinning-wheel and
loom had been long silent, and for a few days she
had not left her bed.</p>
<p>Her eyes gleamed with strange, new fire as they
fell upon the shining thing which belonged to another
world from theirs, and when Steve had laboriously
wound it, which he had not forgotten how to
do, setting the wonderful machinery running, she
whispered to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember you air goin&rsquo; whar you kin larn to
make things lack that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s shining eyes answered hers, though the
boy failed to catch the light of prophecy and final
benediction which they held. Hugging his treasure,
with no hint of oncoming change he went out to
feed the stranger&rsquo;s horse while Mirandy prepared the
dinner.</p>
<p>It was not until the visitor had gone and Steve
was in the solitude of the woods with Tige that he
found fullest joy in his new possession. It seemed
to him he could never in all his life take his eyes
from it again. He watched the hands go round and
round, the little flying second hand, the more leisurely
minute marker and the creeping hand which
told the hours as they passed. Then again and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
again the back was opened and the busy little wheels
held his breathless interest. He took no notice of
Tige, but the old dog knew that his mate was happy
and lay content beside him. Although for the first
time in possession of a noter of the hours, he lost all
account of time and did not move from the mossy
bed where he had thrown himself until it was too
late to see either hands or wheels. Then he called
Tige to come and hurried back to his home to sit by
the cabin firelight till Mirandy made him go to bed.
The family all slept in the same room, three beds occupying
corners; this main room and the lean-to
kitchen constituting the whole house.</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s watch never left his hand the long night
through, and for the first time in his uneventful life
he slept fitfully, waking every little while to make
sure it was there.</p>
<p>Jim Langly was away for a few days &ldquo;to a logrolling&rdquo;
several miles away and did not return until
dusk of the evening after Steve&rsquo;s watch came. The
boy sat again by the firelight, watch in hand, when
Jim walked in at the door. His eyes fell at once
upon the strange, shining thing and his face was convulsed
with sudden wrath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell ye to have nothin&rsquo; to do with city
folks? Ye shan&rsquo;t keep that thing. I&rsquo;ll smash it, so
he&rsquo;p me God!&rdquo; But before he could lift a hand a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
scream came from the bed, and Mrs. Langly sat up
wild and dishevelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him hev it, Jim Langly, let him hev it,&rdquo; and
then she dropped back gray and still. Jim Langly
had seen that gray stillness before, and he stood
looking upon it now in dumb terror. His wife had
been ailing a long time, it was true, yet no one had
thought of death. But the grim visitor was there in
all his quiet majesty. The weary spirit, which had
for so many years longed for flight into new haunts
of men, had winged its way at last to a far, mysterious
country of which she had heard little, but
towards which for months past she had been reaching
out with a strange prescience of which no one
guessed.</p>
<p>It was a dreary night at the cabin. No one tried
to sleep. Jim Langly said no more to Steve about
the watch, and the boy wore it in his bosom attached
to a stout string about his neck, keeping it out of
sight, and sobbing in the stillness of the woods as he
wandered with Tige, &ldquo;Mammy wanted me to have
it.&rdquo; And though his joy in it for the time was gone,
there was peculiar comfort in this thought of her approval.
The old dog looked up in the boy&rsquo;s face
from time to time pitifully, or stuck his nose in the
lad&rsquo;s hand, knowing well, in a way dogs have, what
had happened.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>Next day the wife and mother was laid to rest beside
the row of little graves, and life completely
changed for Steve. He went to bed as usual in his
corner of the room, but he could not forget the still
form which had lain in another corner the night before,
and while Mirandy and his father slept heavily,
he slipped from the bed, took a blanket and with
Tige at his heels went into the woods again. Here
in the stillness which he loved, worn out with loss of
sleep and his first encounter with grief, nestling close
to old Tige slumber came and held him until late the
next day. His father and Mirandy paid little attention
to what he did, so night after night he took his
blanket and dog and slept in the woods, the two only
going to the cabin for meals.</p>
<p>During all these strange, restless days the words
of Steve&rsquo;s mother came to him over and over: &ldquo;Remember
you air goin&rsquo; whar you kin larn to make
things lack that watch.&rdquo; And he thought, &ldquo;How
am I a-goin&rsquo; lessen I jes&rsquo; go?&rdquo; He knew his father
would never give him permission, it was not worth
while to ask it, so gradually his plans took shape in
the solitude of the woods with no one to counsel.
Had the boy known what distance lay between him
and his goal he would have grown faint-hearted, but
he had no conception of what his undertaking meant.
So he laid his plans with good courage, which plans,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
of course, included the taking of his dog. For three
or four days Steve took an extra share of corn pone
and bacon, Mirandy not noticing in her shiftless
manner of providing, and feeling the loss of her
mother, she was even more listless than usual. These
extra rations for himself and Tige Steve carried to
the woods and laid away. Then his beloved fox
skin, the greatest treasure which he possessed beside
the watch, he must take that with him, because it
was &ldquo;the man&rsquo;s&rdquo;; he had promised it in return for
the watch, and now that he was going he must take
it along to give to the man. The boy had no
thought of any difficulty in such a search. The
food, the skin, the watch, and the scanty clothes he
wore constituted all his equipment for the journey.
When he started out with the skin Mirandy lazily
asked what he was going to do with it, and he replied:
&ldquo;Use it fer a piller in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye better quit sleepin&rsquo; out thar,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;somethin&rsquo;
&rsquo;ll eat ye up some night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-feerd,&rdquo; he said, and she thought no more
about it.</p>
<p>Three days passed with a good accumulation of
food, and as Steve and Tige lay down to sleep at
night the boy said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tige, we&rsquo;ve gotter be a-goin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout day arter ter-morrer,&rdquo;
and the dog wagged sleepy assent. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
next morning when Steve wakened a peculiar stillness
smote him. Tige was usually alert at his least
move. With intuitive alarm Steve put out his hand,&ndash;&ndash;and
touched a rigid body! Drawing back he
sprang to his feet, a cry of anguished appeal on his
lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Tige, Tige, ye ain&rsquo;t dead too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But death makes no reply. His lifelong playmate
lay straightened out in that last unalterable, mysterious
sleep.</p>
<p>The boy was too stunned for tears. He knelt
beside his dog in silent misery. After a long while
he rose from the ground and going to a moss-covered
rock near by where laurel and forget-me-nots
blossomed and rhododendron bells hung in clusters,
with a stout stick and his sturdy hands he dug
beneath the rock an opening large enough to hold
his dead dog. Then he went back to where his old
playmate lay, and lifting the stiffened body in his
arms he stumbled blindly to the rock and laid it away.</p>
<p>Towards evening he slowly made his lonely way
home.</p>
<p>Mirandy, missing the dog at last, inquired:
&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s Tige?&rdquo; and Steve&rsquo;s stiff lips articulated the
one word, &ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied indifferently, &ldquo;Wal, he want no &rsquo;count
any mo&rsquo;. I reckons hit&rsquo;s a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>Steve had no answer and with swelling heart made
his way to the woods to sleep alone. It was long
before he could sleep, and as he lay in the unbearable
loneliness, he decided that next morning he
would start on that journey to the unknown. Perhaps
to that new world sorrow would not follow!
He would not need so much food now; he had
enough saved already. The death of the dog urged
him on to his purpose as nothing else could have
done.</p>
<p>He went down to the cabin next morning for the
last time. It was a warm spring morning. Passing
Mirandy sitting on the door-step, her breakfast
dishes not yet washed, he paused a minute, longing
to say something, for although the bond between
them was of blood and not of the heart, yet she was
part of the life from which he was tearing himself
away, and he longed to sob out a good-bye. But he
must not, so choking down words and tears he
stumbled off, never once looking back. His father
sat in the chimney corner smoking his morning pipe,
but father and son had always lacked interests in
common, and the coming of the watch had put an
insurmountable barrier between them. So Steve&rsquo;s
only thought in passing him had been to escape
suspicion. It was to his mother that the boy had
always shyly told his day-dreams in the woods,&ndash;&ndash;dreams
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
which reached out into a wonder world lying
beyond the mountains. And she had smoked her
pipe in silent sympathy, occasionally asking: &ldquo;Did
ye see big houses, rows and rows of &rsquo;em on land, and
some a-ridin&rsquo; the water? I&rsquo;ve hearn tell of &rsquo;em in
my day,&rdquo; so furnishing inspiration for more dreams
in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Mammy, O Tige,&rdquo; sobbed the boy when safe
at last in the woods, and he threw himself down
in an agony of weeping beside the rock where the
old dog lay buried. When calm at last, he took up
his bundle of bread and bacon wrapped about with
his fox skin, and started slowly away. He took no
thought as to direction, he was simply &ldquo;goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; as
his mother had told him. A dismal rain soon set in,
but on and on he persistently tramped all the long
day, water dripping from his ragged trousers and old
hat as he went farther and farther away from all he
had ever known. He met no one, saw no habitation
anywhere, only the startled denizens of the wood
scurrying here and there out of his path. Over
mountains and across ravines he went on and on.
He was puzzled and discouraged when night dropped
down, and his aching feet and tired legs said he must
have travelled many miles. &ldquo;Shorely I&rsquo;ll git thar
to-morrer,&rdquo; he said, as he lay down upon his fox skin,
but another weary day of tramping over unknown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
ways without sight of any human being brought terror
to his sturdy heart and when he lay down alone
at night he felt that he was the only human being
in the universe. Oh, if he only had Tige!</p>
<p>All the people he had known and those he expected
to see beyond the mountains seemed to have
sunk into some great unseen abyss. He could
never find his way back to the old cabin, he knew,
and he began to feel that he could never reach forward
to the wonderful city of which he had
dreamed. In the agony of loneliness and the chill
of night which settled upon him he cried again, &ldquo;O
Tige, O Mammy!&rdquo; Did the tender mother-arms
reach down and draw her boy near to the heart of
God? At any rate he grew quiet. He remembered
vaguely that he had heard how God is everywhere,
and with a new strange sense of companionship with
the great Creator, which comes to souls in extremity,
he fell asleep and did not waken until the sun, bursting
forth with new brilliance after the day of rain,
had lit up the mountain tops and set the birds to
singing.</p>
<p>He enjoyed the breakfast of very hard corn pone
and bacon, and took out his beloved watch. The
busy, little shining thing, which he never forgot to
wind, did not mean much to him as a marker of time,
for he knew little about the hours as enumerated by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
the watch, but it was on this morning of new courage
a fresh pledge of wonderful things awaiting him. He
started on again with steady strides, and tramped
bravely till mid afternoon without adventure.</p>
<p>Suddenly, without premonition, his heart thrilled at
faint sounds which seemed marvellously like those of
a human voice. He stood still a moment in an
agony of uncertainty, straining eye and ear for confirmation.</p>
<p>Yes, he was right! He caught the crackle of dry
twigs and underbrush, while the faint human tones
grew clear and distinct. Under the discipline of
loneliness and distress the face of the untutored boy
beamed with eager welcome which held no reserve
and caught no suspicious glimmer of lurking treachery
as near-by bushes parted and steps were close upon
him.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>IN THE WILDERNESS</h3>
</div>
<p>Two men were before him, men very similar
in appearance to those Steve had known,
though with something in their faces
which made him draw back even in the moment of
joy at meeting others of his kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes erlive, Bub, whar&rsquo;d ye come from?&rdquo; called
the taller, harder looking of the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come from Hollow Hut,&rdquo; answered the boy
with his simple dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whar you goin&rsquo; to?&rdquo; called the other man,
while both laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ter the city,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, now, that&rsquo;s a pretty nice fox skin ye got
rolled up thar,&rdquo; said the tall one as they came closer.
&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you jes&rsquo; hand that over to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the boy, holding it tighter in real
alarm. &ldquo;I swapped it with a man fer a watch, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m a-takin&rsquo; it ter him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; exclaimed the tall man. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve
got a watch, hev ye? Who&rsquo;d a-thought it,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and
they both haw-hawed loudly. &ldquo;Now, ye can jes&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
han&rsquo; that over too, fer we mean bizness, don&rsquo;t we,
Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that they pounced upon the terrified
boy, jerked the fox skin from his clinging fingers and
soon brought forth from its hiding-place in his bosom
the beautiful, beautiful watch! Steve fought like a
small tiger, but he was no match for them and
stunned and bruised he soon lay upon the ground
while the two men walked off, never once looking
back at their helpless victim.</p>
<p>For a few minutes Steve could not think, so severe
had been their cruel blows; then indignation, such as
he had never known in his life, swept over him in a
sudden flood. He sprang to his feet, ignoring pain
and keenly watching which way they went, stealthily
followed after. For two hours he kept within hearing
of them, though being careful always that they
did not get a glimpse of him. He did not know
what he was going to do, but when they finally
halted for the night he halted too. The men had
also taken the last of his corn pone and bacon; there
was nothing for him to eat, but he did not even
think of it, so intently was he listening. Soon they
began to sing and laugh very loudly and he knew
then they had plenty of whiskey with them. Hope
rose in his heart. After a bit they would fall into
heavy sleep. He knew well the ways of drink.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>Soon all was still, and after waiting a while till the
sleep was deep he crept upon them. Fortunately
the moon was up in its full glory and Steve could
see plainly what he was about. He crept up close
to the two snoring men and across the feet of the tall
one lay his fox skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must git that anyways,&rdquo; said the boy to himself,
&ldquo;for it belongs to the man in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, cautiously he lifted it from the big heavy
feet, and there was not a stir. Then he stood, his
heart almost bursting with longing for his watch. It
was in the big man&rsquo;s pocket he was sure, and he
stooped close a minute, reaching out a hand,&ndash;&ndash;but he
didn&rsquo;t dare. If he waked them, skin and watch
would both be gone, and he must by all means get
the skin to give to the man in the city. He went
sorrowfully away with only the skin. He didn&rsquo;t
dare stop near them, so he tramped half the night
in spite of frequent twinges in his left ankle which
had had a little twist as the men threw him down,
and at last the boy dropped upon the ground, utterly
exhausted, to sleep until noon next day.</p>
<p>When he wakened, stiff and sore from the blows
of the men, and tried to get upon his feet he found
that left ankle so swollen and painful he could not
put the foot to the ground. He realized for the first
time also with great consternation that he had nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
to eat. Bruised, sore, empty, helpless he sat alone in
the woods. But even then he did not know the
desolation of the night before. He felt once more
that comforting sense of companionship with the
great Creator, and he faced the situation sturdily.</p>
<p>He crept about on his knees hunting berries which
he knew were good to eat. It was a laborious way
to get breakfast, or more properly dinner, but he
succeeded in finding enough to still somewhat the
gnawing in his empty stomach, and suddenly as he
lifted his head a road lay before him. With hope
that was almost a tranquil certainty he crept to the
roadside and sat down. An hour or more passed
with only the call and song of birds to break the
stillness,&ndash;&ndash;when, list! There was surely a rumble of
wheels! And then the cry came distinctly, &ldquo;Git up
thar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears of joy rained down the boy&rsquo;s face as a covered
wagon drawn by four mules came into view,
though he sturdily brushed them aside as the wagon
drove up and halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, thar,&rdquo; called a lusty youthful voice, and
the driver, a young fellow of perhaps nineteen who
was mounted on one of the mules, turned round and
saw at a glance the swollen, helpless foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done up, air ye, Bub? Whar do ye belong anyways?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>Steve knew at once that these people were friends,
and told them his little story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to git to the city, so&rsquo;s to give the skin to
the man thar an&rsquo; then I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to larn to make
watches an&rsquo; things,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, you air a long piece from the city, but we
uns kin help ye git to the railroad and that&rsquo;ll take ye
to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several heads of varying sizes were sticking out of
the wagon by this time, and when Steve had been
helped in among the occupants he found it was a
family moving from one little hamlet to another.
The husband and father had recently died and they
were going back to their mother&rsquo;s home to live
among her &ldquo;kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kindly mother at once bound up Steve&rsquo;s injured
foot with white of egg and salt, which she said
would &ldquo;fetch it round all right,&rdquo; and hearing the
empty rumbles of his poor little stomach she said she
didn&rsquo;t believe &ldquo;thar was a thing inside of it,&rdquo; and
proceeded to give him a good square meal.</p>
<p>Was there ever anything happier than to be driving
along the road with a comfortable foot, a full
stomach and in the midst of friends! Steve had
never known greater joy than that moment held.
They were a &ldquo;happy-go-lucky&rdquo; family he had fallen
in with,&ndash;&ndash;and for the first time in his life he was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the midst of the merry banter of children. The
mountain folk of remote regions lack a sense of
humour, and Steve had grown up entirely alone, the
cabins of Hollow Hut being scattered, so he sat
through the afternoon in a maze of delight. There
were snickers and giggles, punching in the ribs and
tickling of toes from these children who lived on the
border of civilization, for Steve had really gone
blindly towards his goal.</p>
<p>As they drove gaily along Steve heard a sudden
rumbling which suggested thunder, the children cried,
&ldquo;The train, the train,&rdquo; and stopping the mules
quickly the big brother who was driving jumped
down, while three of the children sprang out with a
bound and all grasped the bridles at their heads. It
was done so quickly there wasn&rsquo;t time to ask a question
and then a monster came tearing, puffing, hissing
past them. Steve&rsquo;s eyes almost started from
their sockets and when it was past he sank back limp
and quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, chile, didn&rsquo;t ye nuver see no railroad trains
afore?&rdquo; said the good mother.</p>
<p>Steve managed to say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and then the children
told him all the astonishing things about
railroads. To his mingled joy and terror another
came along from the opposite direction when
they had driven on about a mile further, and this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
time it came more slowly, making a full stop near
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whut air they a-doin&rsquo; that for?&rdquo; asked Steve,
and when it was explained that they had stopped for
fuel or water, there being no station near, a quivering
light broke over his face, and remembering his
watch as his mind tried to grasp new sources of
motion, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re jes&rsquo; a-stoppin&rsquo; to wind hit up, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very soon after this they came to a cabin by the
roadside and all the family within poured out to see
the strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you light and hitch?&rdquo; drawled the man
of the house, but the boy driver refused, saying they
wanted &ldquo;to git to their kin afore night.&rdquo; He suggested
to Steve, however, that if he wanted to go to
the city he had better stop there, for they were going
further from any station than he would be there.
The folks of the cabin were hearty in their invitation
to the boy when they had heard his story, even the
fact of his probable helplessness for a while not marring
the beauty of their royal hospitality. So Steve
was carefully lifted out and helped in among new
friends.</p>
<p>The little cabin was full to overflowing with boys
and girls, one girl of fifteen fondling her baby as she
would a big doll, in ignorant, unlawful, and one perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
should say innocent motherhood. She, a waif
herself, had come along needing shelter and they
had taken her in.</p>
<p>When Steve had had his supper pallets were
spread everywhere about the cabin floor upon which
the family went to rest fully clothed, after the fashion
of mountaineers, and to the boy the night was a
great contrast from the previous one in the loneliness
of the woods. He thought of his own home as he
had never done since he left it, wondering if his
father and Mirandy would like to see him, but he
never dreamed of how they had searched the woods
for miles around when he was missed the second day
after leaving. His failure to return the first day and
night they thought little of, for he frequently did not
come back after morning, but the second day&rsquo;s absence
had brought real alarm, and when they found
his blanket Mirandy said she knew something had
killed and eat him up; she had forgotten about the
fox skin which in that case should also have been
there. But Jim Langly set his teeth grimly and said
the boy had gone off &ldquo;along o&rsquo; that watch,&rdquo; and he
did not cease to make inquiry as he had opportunity,
trying to trace his son, while he angrily threatened to
kill that city man if ever he &ldquo;showed up agin in them
parts.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>A HALT ON THE ROAD</h3>
</div>
<p>Steve spent a week in the crowded but hospitable
cabin of his latest friends resting the
swollen foot. It was not seriously sprained
and would have given him no trouble but for the
long tramp upon it the night before and his general
fatigue.</p>
<p>He had an interesting time with this family on the
roadside. They were of the most shiftless type of
mountain folk. Life was a long holiday to them,
every meal a picnic. There were too many to
gather about the table in the little log lean-to, so the
elders only sat down at meal times. The children
came up shuffling, pushing and squirming good naturedly
to get their portions and ran away again full-handed
to sit on the door-step or flat upon the
ground outside while they ate. Sometimes one ambitious
consumer would succeed in disposing of his
viands more rapidly than the others and then woe to
some small delinquent! His food would be snatched
away and a lively fisticuff probably follow during
which the inevitable &ldquo;yaller dog&rdquo; was usually the
gainer. The disturbance at times reached a height
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
which brought the mother lazily to the door with a
mild:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ef ye alls don&rsquo;t quit fussin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll set the
boogers arter ye ter-night,&rdquo; which was a dire and
telling threat, for, to the mountain children,
&ldquo;boogers&rdquo; meant ghosts, witches, hobgoblins,
thieves, or any other terrible, mysterious creature
of the night.</p>
<p>Steve went up to the table with the rest for his
portion of food, and took his chances with the other
children if a squabble began. Association with the
children was most enjoyable to Steve. They told
marvellous tales about giants and mountain feuds
and the mother&rsquo;s threat of &ldquo;boogers&rdquo; was sure to
stir up all their recollections about ghosts. Wherever
there was a &ldquo;killin&rsquo;&rdquo; as the result of a mountain
feud ghosts were sure to congregate and marvellous
were the tales which clustered about each bloody
spot. Steve being a new listener must hear all these
old tragic stories.</p>
<p>When meals were over, the family disposed themselves
to their liking. The head of the house invariably
lit his pipe and sat in the chimney corner to
smoke, a custom quite familiar to Steve. The
mother washed the skillet and few utensils used
about the meal, smoking her pipe the while. The
young girl sat down outside in the sun to play with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
her baby, the big boys perhaps went off hunting and
the children wandered aimlessly in and out.</p>
<p>The fields of corn and tobacco had been planted
and now there was little to do but watch it grow, so
they thought. The hogs practically took care of
themselves. What more could any one demand, a
blank look would unconsciously have inquired, if
asked why they did not work.</p>
<p>When the day was over and the troop of children
began to grow sleepy, one after another dropped
down upon the cabin floor, perhaps upon a pallet,
perhaps not, and fell asleep. The older ones followed
in the same way, as inclination suggested, and
room was cheerfully made for Steve among the rest.
For a night or two the full chorus of audible breathing
wakened him frequently, but he soon became accustomed
to it.</p>
<p>In the morning the voice of some child was apt to
be heard first:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mammy, I&rsquo;m hongry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the reply would come, &ldquo;Now you shet up,
&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t time ter be gittin&rsquo; up yit,&rdquo; or perhaps the
satisfied parent would yawn and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckons I might as well git up and stop
ye mouth,&rdquo; and so the household would gradually
emerge from slumber.</p>
<p>This was the normal daily life, but comedy and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
tragedy came to them as to the rest of the world, and
Steve had a taste of both during his stay of a week.</p>
<p>Unlike Hollow Hut it was a somewhat thickly
settled community and one moonlight night some
young folks from neighbouring cabins came in.
Steve&rsquo;s friends made the visitors welcome and hailed
with delight the banjo which one of them had
brought. The young folks were out for a frolic and
laugh and joke were ready.</p>
<p>Pretty soon the banjo began to tune up and set
everybody&rsquo;s feet to patting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear out things,&rdquo; called one of the boys, and in
no time the few articles the room held were out of
the way. Then the air vibrated with &ldquo;Hook and
Line,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sourwood Mountain,&rdquo; and other lively
tunes, while everybody danced except Steve, who
crept to the farthest corner and in wonder looked
and listened. He had never seen dancing or heard
music before.</p>
<p>The girl with the baby came and dropped it down
upon his lap while she joined in the fun, and it almost
seemed that the cabin itself would break from
its moorings in the abandon of rollicking, swaying
motion.</p>
<p>When everybody was tired out the banjo player,
a young fellow with deep-set black eyes and the unmistakable
look of an artist in embryo, swung into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
monologue accompanied by the banjo, part talk, part
song, describing a fox hunt which was most fascinating
and altogether remarkable.</p>
<p>He called the hounds with &ldquo;Here Tige,&rdquo; &ldquo;Here
Jack,&rdquo; &ldquo;Here Spot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Here Bob-tail,&rdquo; interspersed
with the tooting of a horn, long musical whistles and
the banjo striking soft staccato chords. He mustered
the men, he raced the horses with excited calls of
&ldquo;Git up thar,&rdquo; and gave clever imitation of fleeing
hoofs, &ldquo;to-bucket, to-bucket, to-bucket,&rdquo; in a rapid,
low, chanting song. Then the leading hound opened
with a plaintive bay &ldquo;how!-oo-oo-oo, how!-oo-oo-oo,&rdquo;
and one by one the others joined in with
varying notes till it swelled to a weird chorus of baying
hounds which the banjo and the musician&rsquo;s voice
made most realistic. Next the fox was spied and
there were cries of &ldquo;Hello! Ho! Here he is!&rdquo;
&ldquo;There he runs,&rdquo; with the banjo thumping like
mad! Then the medley shaded down into a wild,
monotonous drumming from the strings and the
voice, which represented most thrillingly the chase
at full height. At last the fox was caught with dogs
barking, men calling, and banjo shrilling a triumphant
strain in stirring climax.</p>
<p>Steve followed it all in breathless excitement, and
the rest of the audience received it with boisterous
enthusiasm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>After this somebody started the lovely old ballad,
&ldquo;Barbary Allen,&rdquo; in which all joined; then, &ldquo;I have
a True Love in the Army,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Swapping
Song&rdquo; followed, while &ldquo;Whistle up your Dogs,
Boys, and Shoulder your Guns,&rdquo; made lively the
leave-taking and echoed back from far down the
road.</p>
<p>Then there was a night of tragedy during Steve&rsquo;s
visit. The sleepers of the cabin were suddenly
aroused by blood-curdling whoops and yells, gunshots,
racing horses and running men. Everybody
was instantly alert and the family turned out of the
cabin en masse. It was thrilling. All knew well
what it meant. The head of the house and older
boys joined the fleeing crowd like dogs in a chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Bud Levit&rsquo;s folks and the Cuneys done
broke out agin &rsquo;bout that ole fuss, I bet,&rdquo; drawled
the wife and mother, when the tumult had died
down to faint echoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon thar&rsquo;ll be a big killin&rsquo; this time,&rdquo; said
one of the children with zest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar shore was a passle er folks and a pile er
shootin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said another enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you-alls git back to bed an&rsquo; shet up,&rdquo; said
the mother, and her brood gradually quieted down.</p>
<p>Next day when the man of the house and older
boys returned about dark, full of whiskey and full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
talk, a most exciting tale was unfolded to the eager
listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit was the biggest killin&rsquo; whut&rsquo;s been in these
parts fur many er day,&rdquo; said the man with pride.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye when they did git together they fit
lack beastes. When ev&rsquo;ythin&rsquo; was over thar was five
on &rsquo;em a-layin&rsquo; in their blood. Three of the Levits
an&rsquo; two of the Cuneys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I hope they&rsquo;ll keep quiet fer a spell now,&rdquo;
commented the woman.</p>
<p>Then all the ghastly details were gone over with
the children listening eagerly, drinking it in as they
would a story of an exciting hunt. When the children
discussed it afterwards one little fellow said to
another: &ldquo;I tell yer what, I&rsquo;m er goin&rsquo; ter be a
fighter jes&rsquo; lack them Levits. I&rsquo;ll shoot &rsquo;em down ef
anybody comes foolin&rsquo; round me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve listened soberly. The experience was not a
new one to him, but he remembered that his
&ldquo;Mammy&rdquo; had always said she didn&rsquo;t like killings
and that mountain folks ought to &ldquo;larn better some
way.&rdquo; The words came back to the boy with peculiar
meaning since the voice which uttered them was
still. He said nothing, but it all made him more
anxious to move on towards that other world of which
he and &ldquo;Mammy&rdquo; had dreamed.</p>
<p>The following morning his foot seeming fully restored
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
and clearing weather having come after several
days of rain, Steve said &ldquo;he thought he&rsquo;d move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar ye goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the man of the house who
had paid little attention to him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m er goin&rsquo; to the railroad fust, an&rsquo; then from
thar to the city to give the fox skin to the man, an&rsquo;
to larn things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larn things,&rdquo; said the man scornfully, not being
in the best of humour after the previous day&rsquo;s dissipation.
&ldquo;Huh! I s&rsquo;pose ye&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; to some er them
city schools. Ye better go on back whar you come
from. Schoolin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t no good ter anybody. Hit&rsquo;s
them schools whut larns folks to go &rsquo;round pesterin&rsquo;
other folks, breakin&rsquo; up &lsquo;stills.&rsquo; Folks has got jest
as good er right ter make whiskey es anything else,&rdquo;
which showed in what he was especially interested.</p>
<p>Steve made no answer for the man was too forbidding
in his irritability, but the boy kept to his determination
to press on at once towards the railroad.
After breakfast was over he went back to see the
woman of the house, and in lazy kindness she said
she wished she had a little bread and meat to give
him but &ldquo;there wan&rsquo;t none left,&rdquo; which Steve was
quite prepared to hear, for there were many mouths
to feed and never any left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;ll git thar all right. I reckons ye&rsquo;ll git
somethin&rsquo; to eat on the road, and ef ye&rsquo;re ever to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
come this-a-way agin come an&rsquo; see us,&rdquo; she drawled
as she smoked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye been mighty good ter me,&rdquo; said Steve, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I
ain&rsquo;t nuver goin&rsquo; ter forgit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed the children about the door-step, his
fox skin under his arm, and they stood and watched
him leave with a sort of sorrowful solemnity. Goodbyes
are a thing unknown to mountain folk.</p>
<p>Then he walked off without much thought as to
direction, having a definite impression, however, as
to the way he should go, which was part instinct and
partly remembrance of what the boy on the moving
wagon had told him. The people he had left were
too inert to think of giving him any instructions.
But down the road he passed the big boys of the
house sitting idly by the roadside. They had heard
with satisfaction their father&rsquo;s opinion as to Steve&rsquo;s
going in search of &ldquo;larnin&rsquo;.&rdquo; As Steve came in
sight one of them nudged the other and said, &ldquo;Less
throw him off the scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which-a-way ye goin&rsquo;, Bub?&rdquo; he asked when
Steve came up.</p>
<p>Then for the first time Steve stopped and thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that-a-way,&rdquo; he replied pointing.</p>
<p>The big boys laughed boisterously. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll nuver
git to no railroad goin&rsquo; that-a-way. Thar&rsquo;s the way
ye want ter go,&rdquo; said one, pointing off at a slightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
different angle, which made the greatest difference in
the boy&rsquo;s ultimate destination.</p>
<p>Steve looked doubtfully, but when he reflected a
moment he remembered that he really did not know
positively in what direction to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; he inquired looking earnestly at the
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit shore is,&rdquo; returned both of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fur is it?&rdquo; asked Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t fur,&rdquo; said one of the boys; &ldquo;ye ought
ter git thar before night easy. You go straight as a
crow flies that-a-way,&rdquo; pointing as he had before,
&ldquo;and ye&rsquo;ll come to the railroad tracks. Ye can&rsquo;t
miss hit fer ye&rsquo;re bound to cross &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; ef ye go
straight, lack I tell ye, ye&rsquo;ll be right at the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy on the moving wagon had described the
railroad tracks to him, so Steve started off feeling
reassured, and it never occurred to him that any one
could be mean enough to misdirect him. It was a
pity the echoes from the boisterous laughter of the
boys when he was out of hearing could not have
reached the little traveller&rsquo;s ears, but they did not, and
Steve pressed on with good spirits feeling that he
was almost in sight of his goal with less than a day&rsquo;s
journey before him.</p>
<p>He turned at once from the road and went on and
on, knowing as well as the crow how to keep straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
with the compass, although like the crow he had
never heard of one. The straight path took him
quickly into the wilderness, but that did not dismay
him as wilderness travel had become most familiar to
him. At noon he began to feel so empty, he longed
for just a little piece of corn bread. And then remembering
that the mother thought he&rsquo;d get something
to eat on the road he began looking cheerfully
for the smoke of a cabin somewhere. He had been
vaguely disappointed at striking no road anywhere,
but he had not asked the boys any particulars as to
the route. Everything so far in his journeying had
been unexpected, and the possibilities of routes were
so totally unknown to him that he had started on
again, as when he left home, unquestioning.</p>
<p>The empty stomach continued to cry loudly for
food as the afternoon wore on, and no cabin smoke
gave token of life anywhere. He did not suffer from
thirst for mountain streams and springs were abundant.
He pressed bravely forward, cheering himself
with the thought that the boys had said he would
come to the tracks before dark. But twilight began
creeping in among the forest trees and still no tracks
were in sight. Anxiously he listened for the terrible
yet thrilling rush of a train which he remembered
so well. He ought to be in hearing distance
of them by now. But nothing broke the forest stillness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
save the twitter and song of birds, the scurrying
of rabbits or frisking of squirrels with occasionally
the sound of some larger animal in the underbrush.</p>
<p>Finally night fell with the poor boy straining his
anxious eyes for the shining tracks of which he had
heard. He forced his aching limbs along till suddenly,
with a quivering sob, his strength seemed all
to go and he sank upon the ground in a pitiful heap.
He was too exhausted to think and in a few moments
was sound asleep.</p>
<p>He lay upon the summit of a rugged mountain,
which dropped precipitately down just beyond the
sleeping boy, to ripple off again in lesser lofty
heights, with beautiful fertile valleys and tossing
streams between. A little, lonely, helpless human
soul he lay upon Nature&rsquo;s majestic bosom, with the
Infinite hand beneath his head.</p>
<p>In the morning when he waked billows of mist in
silver splendour were rolling slowly from the valleys
below, like Nature&rsquo;s incense rising in her sacred
morning hour.</p>
<p>Although born in the mountains the mystic
grandeur of the scene filled Steve with awe. Rising,
he gazed, a part of the worshipful silence, and then
as the sun burst suddenly into golden glory above
the waves of mist, his mind as suddenly seemed to
shoot up from the mists of fatigue and sleep. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the peculiarly clear brain which sometimes comes
with long abstinence from food. Instantly he knew
that he had been fooled!</p>
<p>Turning to look back over the way he had come
he said to himself: &ldquo;Them boys told me wrong, an&rsquo;
they did hit a purpose. They&rsquo;re lack their pappy,
they don&rsquo;t want to larn nothin&rsquo; an&rsquo; they don&rsquo;t want
nobody else ter nuther.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>V</h2>
<h3>A DOUBLE RESCUE</h3>
</div>
<p>The boy stood quietly on the mountain top
and took his bearings. He knew the way
he had come, and remembering his previous
impressions, and what his friend on the moving
wagon had said, he turned at last and started down
at an acute angle from the direction he had come.
He gathered again as he went whatever he knew to
be good to eat in the way of berries and herbs, but
he soon began to feel so weary that he could hardly
drag himself along. Had he gotten out of the wilderness
only to plunge into it again and be lost?
For as the day went on and he met no one, saw no
cabin or the long-looked-for railroad tracks, discouragement
and anxiety beset him. Noon passed again.
Sometimes he thought he must stop and rest, but he
was afraid if he did he could never get up again.
His fatigue and hunger were far greater than in his
previous experience in the wilderness, for he had
never eaten heartily at the roadside cabin, knowing
that food was not abundant there. So he was not in
the best of trim for a long fast and great physical
strain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>The remnants of his courage were wearing away
when at last he seemed to be emerging into a more
open country. He was still in the woods, but there
was a subtle difference. He felt somehow that man
was in proximity somewhere, though he had as yet
seen no sign. His pulses quickened a little, and then
suddenly a child&rsquo;s scream rang out.</p>
<p>Steve bounded forward at first with joy, and then
as scream after scream followed, with the unmistakable
agony of fear in the cry, forgetting his deadly
weariness he ran swiftly in the direction of the sound,
dropping the fox skin as he ran. In a breathless
moment he came in sight of a good sized tree, and
hanging from a high limb by the skirt of her dress
was a little girl, head downward.</p>
<p>Steve saw in an instant that she could not help
herself, and that she might fall to her death any
moment. He did not pause or hesitate. Up the
tree he went, his bare feet clinging to the sides, up
and up in a twinkling, then he carefully crept out
upon the limb and drew the little girl safely up beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said when she had recovered her equilibrium
and gotten her breath, &ldquo;I thank you so much,&rdquo;
and even then Steve was conscious that he had never
seen anything so pretty in all his life as the blue eyes
which looked up into his, and the soft yellow curls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
which framed her little face. But he hurried to get
her down safely. With infinite care he helped her
until she could go on down the tree alone, and then,
he did not know what happened, but things suddenly
seemed to whirl round and he fell to the ground in
an unconscious heap.</p>
<p>The next he knew some one was wiping his face
with a damp cloth and chafing his hands. He was
too tired to open his eyes and see who it was. Then
a woman&rsquo;s voice was saying in a worried but gentle
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing in the tree, Nancy? You
know I don&rsquo;t like for you to climb trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; replied a frightened little voice,
&ldquo;I found a poor little birdie out of its nest, and I
pinned it up tight in my apron pocket and carried it
up the tree and put it into the nest. The father and
mother bird were so worried about it. I didn&rsquo;t
know I was going to fall, and make this boy fall too,
and hurt himself so bad,&rdquo; and the small voice broke
pitifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never should have tried to do such a thing,&rdquo;
said her mother firmly, and then as the little voice
went into sobs, Steve opened his eyes in a brave
effort to try to assure them he was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you are better,&rdquo; exclaimed the
woman who knelt beside him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>She looked so kind and nice that Steve struggled
to get up and further reassure her, but there seemed
weights holding him down and a sharp pain thrust
through and through his left arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you have broken your arm,&rdquo; said the
woman anxiously. &ldquo;Nancy, you run right over to
the store and get your father,&rdquo; she said to the little
girl. And Steve watched a white pinafore and flying
yellow curls through a half-conscious dream mist,
with a satisfied sense that he was at last in the new
world of his visions.</p>
<p>And he was, for he had stumbled blindly through
a bit of wood at the back of Mr. Follet&rsquo;s, the station-master&rsquo;s
home, and just in time to rescue his little
girl.</p>
<p>Mrs. Follet had heard the child&rsquo;s screams, for the
tree was in the edge of the wood only a little way
from the house, and she reached the place just
after Steve had fallen to the ground, having seen
the child&rsquo;s perilous position and Steve&rsquo;s rescue.
She had dampened her handkerchief in a near-by
spring and worked over the boy until consciousness
returned.</p>
<p>The little white pinafore was soon running back
with Mr. Follet walking rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What under the cano<i>pee</i> does all this mean?&rdquo;
he asked excitedly as he came up, although Nancy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
had told him about the accident. &ldquo;Are you hurt
much, boy?&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>Steve heard what was said in a vague way, but
he couldn&rsquo;t reply and Mrs. Follet explained that
she didn&rsquo;t think the boy was fully conscious yet,
and they would have to try to get him to the
house.</p>
<p>So Mr. Follet, who was a small but very wiry
man, soon had him up in his arms, while Mrs.
Follet supported his head and together they carried
him to the house and laid him down on a couch.
Then Mrs. Follet quickly fixed him a hot drink
and gave it slowly to him. With each swallow
the sturdy boy felt stronger, and by the time he
had taken a cup full, was able to talk freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where under the cano<i>pee</i> did you come from
anyway? You don&rsquo;t live hereabouts, do you?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Follet, who was of the restless, nervous
temperament which must know things at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Pa,&rdquo; said Mrs. Follet, &ldquo;you must get the
doctor to set his arm before you ask him anything,&rdquo;
and Mr. Follet started off.</p>
<p>Steve looked curiously at the arm hanging limply
by his side. He had never seen a broken arm before
though he had heard that arms and legs could break
and be mended like hoe or ax handles.</p>
<p>By questioning, Mrs. Follet found that he had had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
nothing to eat since the day before, so she prepared
him a dainty meal which filled the mountain boy
with wonder. There was a poached egg, a bit of
toast and a cup of hot milk, none of which had he
ever tasted or seen prepared before. But it all was
very, very good, and as he ate Nancy slipped shyly
into the room. She had stayed outside in frightened
misery, feeling that all the trouble was her fault. Her
mother said kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, child, come on in; our boy is better
now.&rdquo; The little girl sat down timidly on the edge
of a chair, and Steve took in the complete vision.</p>
<p>Soft yellow locks strayed out from a ribbon and
tumbled about before a pair of deep blue eyes.
Round cheeks were pink and soft, sweet lips were
red and shyly smiling, a white apron with ruffles
almost covered a blue gingham dress. The boy held
his breath at the beauty of the apparition. He had
never dreamed of anything so sweet and pretty in all
the world.</p>
<p>It was not long before Mr. Follet returned with the
doctor and the broken arm was successfully set,
Steve bearing the pain &ldquo;like a trump,&rdquo; as Mr. Follet
put it. Then Mrs. Follet said he must go to bed at
once, and he went up a tiny flight of stairs to a bed
in a little attic chamber which she had made ready.
Knowing the ways of mountain folk, Mrs. Follet did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
not insist that he undress, as the task would be difficult
for him with the broken arm. He slept soundly
in spite of pain in the arm upon a remarkable bed
&ldquo;off the floor&rdquo; and awoke feeling well, and eager to
see again his new friends.</p>
<p>When he got down the stairs, Mrs. Follet was
busy getting the breakfast, and Mr. Follet was ready
with questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where under the cano<i>pee</i> (which was a favourite
expression with Mr. Follet) did you drap from yesterday,
just in time to save our Nancy? You don&rsquo;t live
hereabouts, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Steve, &ldquo;I come from Hollow Hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; returned Mr. Follet.</p>
<p>Steve couldn&rsquo;t tell very clearly, but gave an account
of his long journey and told about the watch
and the fox skin which he was going to take to the
man in the city.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Follet were much interested in his
story, so much so that they forgot the waiting breakfast.
Then they turned to it, but Steve had remembered
that he dropped his fox skin as he ran to
Nancy&rsquo;s rescue and he wanted to go at once for it,
but Mrs. Follet would not let him go till he had eaten
breakfast. The neatly laid table with its snowy cloth
was a new wonder to Steve, and when the little girl,
looking fresh and sweet as a rose, sat down opposite
him, he was so awed and thrilled he could scarcely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
eat. Angels could hardly have given him a more
heavenly vision than did this little girl.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, Steve started at once for the fox
skin, and Mrs. Follet sent Nancy with him to help
find it. The little girl lost some of her shyness as
they looked for the skin, and Steve listened to her
chatter, feeling in a strange way that it was all a
dream which he had had before, as we do sometimes
in experiences which move us strongly.</p>
<p>They found the skin with little trouble, and when
they had carried it back to the house, Mr. Follet
took it up and carefully examined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re trying to get this here skin to the man
in the city who sent the watch to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you ain&rsquo;t got hair or hide o&rsquo; the watch
now?&rdquo; continued Mr. Follet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I hain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the boy sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be sniggered,&rdquo; said Mr. Follet. &ldquo;And
how under the cano<i>pee</i> do you expect to find him in
the city when you git thar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s uncomprehending stare showed that he
had no conception of a city, and Mr. Follet looked
at his wife, laughed and went over to the station,
which was station and store combined.</p>
<p>For a few days Steve continued to live in a
dream. The house was a marvel to him. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Follet cooked on a stove and constantly fixed
strange, nice things to eat; a clock ticked on the
mantel, which comforted him somewhat for the loss
of his watch,&ndash;&ndash;there were queer but to him surprisingly
beautiful and comfortable pieces of furniture,
and one room had a nice piece of good stout cloth
with red and green flowers on it spread over the
floor on which people walked!</p>
<p>Then marvel of marvels, every now and then that
engine and great train of cars came puffing and hissing
by the house in full view, and the boy&rsquo;s spirits
mounted on wings as he thought of the wonders of
the world.</p>
<p>Even with one arm disabled, he took hold at once
to help with the work about the place. He fed the
chickens, horse and cow. With only one hand he
could not learn to milk, though he was eager to do
so. He went over to the store on errands and made
himself useful in many ways.</p>
<p>One day when at the store he said to Mr. Follet
that as soon as his arm was well he would have to
be going on to the city to take the fox skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how under the cano<i>pee</i> do you expect to be
ridin&rsquo; round on the railroad without money?&rdquo; said
Mr. Follet. He knew well the boy had none. &ldquo;You
ain&rsquo;t a Rockefeller or a Jay Gould, air you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These allusions of course meant nothing to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
boy, and the question of money was a new one to
him. None of his late friends in their simplicity had
thought of it, and the man had to make clear the
need of it in the business world which Steve had
come into. With his people things had always been
&ldquo;swapped&rdquo;; corn, tobacco and whiskey, for the few
things they needed from a store, and he had seen
very few pieces of money in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how under the cano<i>pee</i> are you going to
come up with the money?&rdquo; asked Mr. Follet briskly,
and with practical pertinence.</p>
<p>Steve certainly did not know and then Mr. Follet
proposed that he stay with them through the summer,
work for him and he would give him his board
and clothes and pay him fifty cents a week.</p>
<p>Steve agreed readily and at once felt a new sense
of responsibility and manliness.</p>
<p>When his arm was quite well Mrs. Follet gave him
some long white garments which she called &ldquo;nightshirts,&rdquo;
and told him to undress at night and wear
them for sleeping! It was a very needless performance,
he felt in his secret heart, but he had already
learned to love the gentle woman and he would have
done even more foolish things to please her. In
fact, the thing which she gave him for brushing his
hair seemed at first to bring him to the limit of acquiescence,
but the bit of broken looking-glass stuck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
in one of the timbers of his room soon told him that
a little smoothing down of his tousled head made an
immense difference in his looks, and somehow made
him seem a little more worthy to be in Nancy&rsquo;s
presence.</p>
<p>The little girl had lessons at night from her mother
in wonderful books, and Steve listened with rapt attention
each time, beginning very soon to catch their
meaning. It was not long till he had confided to
Nancy how his &ldquo;mammy&rdquo; had wanted him to &ldquo;larn
things&rdquo; too, and that was another reason why he
was trying to get to the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to school then,&rdquo; said the little girl.
&ldquo;My mama teaches me, and some day she is going
to send me to a big, big college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Follet had been a school-teacher from the
north in one of the small Kentucky towns, an orphan
girl, who very young had been obliged to make her
own way in the world. She had met Mr. Follet, and
in one of those strange attractions between complete
opposites in temperament and training, had married
him. She was a quiet, refined and very kind-hearted
woman. She would gladly have taught the boy,
but finding that he did not know even his letters, she
felt that with Nancy in the second reader, she could
not take another pupil who was a beginner.</p>
<p>But when the lessons were going on in the evening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
Steve soon began to spell over the words to himself
as Nancy spelled them, and then it came about that
often at odd times the brown shock of hair and the
little yellow curls bent together over bits of paper, as
the little girl pointed out and explained the make-up
of the letters to the big boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, Steve, this little chicken coop
with a piece across it is big A, and this one with the
piece standing up and two curly things at the side is
big B.&rdquo; The peculiarities of similar letters were discussed,
how the bottom curly thing in big R turned
the other way, while P didn&rsquo;t have any bottom curly
thing at all, and F didn&rsquo;t have any bottom cross
piece, while E did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Steve, growing alert, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a
powerful nice gate; whut&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s big H,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;and wriggly,
twisty S is just the prettiest letter of all, I think. Oh,
Steve, that is the letter which begins your name,&rdquo;
said she, in generous, childish joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; exclaimed Steve, with eager pleasure
because she was pleased. &ldquo;And which is the one
whut begins yourn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mine is just two straight standing up pieces
with a slanting piece between. It&rsquo;s one kind of a
gate but not just like H,&rdquo; and she hunted out an N
to show him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> think that&rsquo;s the prettiest letter of all,&rdquo; said
Steve, with unconscious gallantry. &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s the
other letters in yo&rsquo; name?&rdquo; he inquired, and Nancy
hunted them all out. Then she found the other letters
in his name, and Steve had an undefined disappointment
that his name did not have a single letter
in it which belonged to her name. It seemed to shut
him out more completely from the things which belonged
to her.</p>
<p>So the lessons went on from the little girl to the
big boy, and Mrs. Follet was amazed one day to find
that Steve could read quite well. He studied every
book and paper within reach as he found time, though
he never neglected his duties.</p>
<p>Corn was constantly brought Mr. Follet in exchange
for goods at the store, and one of Steve&rsquo;s
duties was to take the old horse with two big bags of
corn over to the Greely mill to be ground into meal.
Nancy was mounted upon the old horse in front of
the bags to show Steve the way on his first trip, and
afterwards she always begged to go. To Steve it was
the greatest joy to take the little girl with him,
though he wouldn&rsquo;t have dared ask it. He taught
her to put her small foot in his hand while he sturdily
lifted her to the old white mare&rsquo;s back, and on the
return she stepped down into his palm with equal
ease.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>The way to the mill lay along the road for a time,
and then a short cut was made across what was known
as the Greely Ridge. It was a steep cliff of rugged
woodland, and both Nancy and Steve enjoyed the
trip through the woods, Steve walking close beside
the horse and the two chatting all the way. He told
the little girl such interesting things about birds and
squirrels, rabbits and foxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish we were birds,&rdquo; said Nancy one
day, &ldquo;so we could fly way off and see lots of
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Steve, &ldquo;I shore do; then I could find
Mr. Polk and give him his fox skin.&rdquo; The thought
of getting to Mr. Polk was always in his mind, and
though the little girl knew all about it she wanted to
hear again how Steve got the skin and about that
wonderful day in the woods when he met Mr. Polk,
and the beautiful watch that the robbers took.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you find Mr. Polk and learn to make
watches and things, like your mother wanted you to,
you will make one just like yours for me, won&rsquo;t you,
Steve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shore will,&rdquo; said Steve earnestly, never
doubting that he would keep his promise.</p>
<p>There was nothing Steve would not attempt for her
pleasure. He went to the tops of trees after some
vacant bird nest or hanging flower, he chased rabbits
and hunted squirrels that she might get a glimpse of
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day, Steve,&rdquo; said Nancy innocently, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
build us a house and live here always; we do have
such good times when we come to this wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve replied again, &ldquo;Yes, I shore will,&rdquo; and neither
dreamed what the wood was hiding for them to be
revealed, far out in the veiled future.</p>
<p>When they reached the mill, Mr. and Mrs. Greely
were always so glad to see them. They had no
children of their own and they liked the straightforward,
dependable boy, while the little girl with her
sweet, shy ways, was always a delight. Mrs. Greely
would often stop her spinning to get a little treat for
them, which they would eat while the corn was
being ground, and going to mill came to make four
people happy each trip.</p>

<a name='VI_AN_UNEXPECTED_MEETING' id='VI_AN_UNEXPECTED_MEETING'></a>
<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</h3>
</div>
<p>Mr. Follet was a man of unique business
methods. He had no idea of orderliness,
though he insisted he knew where everything
was, and strenuously declined his wife&rsquo;s offers
to go over to the store, or stores rather, and help him
&ldquo;straighten up.&rdquo; The stock had overflowed the floor
of the original building and instead of putting in
shelves to dispose of the stock conveniently, he built
another and still another shanty to hold the overflow.
But in spite of queer methods he was making money
steadily. He kept each building securely locked, for
he said he wouldn&rsquo;t have idle folks sitting around in
his store. He went over to the station according to
the railroad time schedule, though it was only a flag
station and was seldom flagged, and whenever he saw
a customer at the store door or on the way, he bustled
over to unlock the door, stumble around in the
dark, for there were no windows, and hunt out what
they wanted.</p>
<p>Bacon, molasses, dress-goods, coffins and farm implements
were on close terms of intimacy and whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
was wanted Mr. Follet could produce with
amazing promptness.</p>
<p>Such methods, however, consumed a great deal of
time on the path between his home and the store,
and Steve filled an urgent need of the combined establishment.</p>
<p>One morning at breakfast in early autumn Mr.
Follet was in a great flutter of excitement. A travelling
auditor of the railroad was to be there for the
day looking over his accounts and this not frequent
event was a sore trial to both the station-master and
the auditor. Each time Mr. Follet said to him nervously:
&ldquo;Now, you know I can&rsquo;t keep things like
the road tells me to, and if things don&rsquo;t just come
out even I&rsquo;ll make up whatever&rsquo;s lacking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the auditor, a big, broad-shouldered, kindly-faced
gentleman arrived on this particular morning,
and was seated for work, Mr. Follet made his usual
statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Follet, all right,&rdquo; said the genial
auditor, &ldquo;we know you are straight as a string. Are
you sure you&rsquo;ve got all the ticket stubs?&rdquo; he continued
as Mr. Follet brought out some bits of pasteboard
from a big bushel basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Follet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t let
nobody in here but myself and so nothing is out of
place.&rdquo; Then thinking a minute, he said, &ldquo;Well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
now I do believe I stuck a few stubs in this tin pail.&rdquo;
He looked, and sure enough there were a few more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bills of lading,&rdquo; said the auditor, &ldquo;are
these all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Follet pondered a moment and then brightening,
exclaimed: &ldquo;Why no, I stuck a few of them in
one of these here coffins one day for safe keeping,&rdquo;
and he stepped over to a grim pine coffin keeping
company with a pile of gay bandanas, and brought
forth another bunch of bills. But his foot caught in
a coil of barbed wire as he started over to the auditor
with them and it was at that moment that Steve came
to the station door to get something and Mr. Follet
called out, &ldquo;Here, Steve, hand these over to the gentleman.&rdquo;
The boy started to obey, but when he
turned and faced the auditor he stood rooted to the
floor, his face white and eyes staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; said Mr. Follet sharply, noticing
him. The auditor looked quickly up also, and the
boy found his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samuel Polk,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>The auditor smiled, and replied pleasantly, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my name, son, and where did you ever know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye sent me the watch,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Polk. &ldquo;So you are
the boy I met in the woods! Well, this is marvellous,
sure, that we should meet here. How did you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
ever get so far away from Hollow Hut?&rdquo; he went on
smiling.</p>
<p>The boy told him briefly, while Mr. Follet listened
with lively interest. When the pitiful tale of the
loss of the watch was told, Steve added sturdily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I got yer fox skin in spite of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
been a-workin&rsquo; to git to the city to give it ter ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working to take the skin to me when you have
no watch,&rdquo; said the auditor, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;hit was yourn jes&rsquo; the
same,&rdquo; and the auditor reached out and drew the boy
to him tenderly, thinking of all the hardship he had
borne in the effort to be square and honest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the boy for me,&rdquo; he said with a glimmer
in his eyes that made Steve feel queer, and he broke
away, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and brung ye the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was back as quickly as his sturdy legs could
bring him, and laid the fox skin on Mr. Polk&rsquo;s knee.
It was gravely accepted and admired, and then Steve
returned to his work with all the earnestness he could
summon after the excitement of this unexpected
meeting.</p>
<p>When Mr. Follet and Mr. Polk came over to dinner
the acquaintance of the two who had met that
November day in the mountains was continued and
Mr. Polk was greatly pleased to find that the boy
was already &ldquo;larnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and astonished at the progress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
which had been made during the summer. On the
way back to the store he said to Mr. Follet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken a great fancy to that boy; he ought to
have a good education. I am all alone in the world
and no good to anybody. If it&rsquo;s all square with you,
I&rsquo;ll take that boy to the city with me this afternoon
when I leave at four-thirty and put him in school
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Follet was amazed and he hated to give up the
boy who had become so useful, but after a moment&rsquo;s
thought, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see as I have anything to say about it.
He just stopped here on his way to you, and you&rsquo;ve
come to him. You&rsquo;ll have to take him if you want
him, though I don&rsquo;t see how under the canopee we&rsquo;ll
get along without him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just like you, Follet, straight always,&rdquo;
said the other warmly, and after a little the station-master
went back to take the news to Steve. It
startled them all and Mrs. Follet expressed her great
regret in seeing the boy go, but she put his few little
belongings in good order and prepared him to start
off &ldquo;clean and whole,&rdquo; as she expressed it. Nancy
looked on wide-eyed, and Steve got ready like one
in a dream. He wrapped his small bundle of clothes
in the fox skin, which Mr. Polk had asked him to
take care of, and went over to the station.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>At four-thirty the train rushed up. Mr. Polk led
Steve into a beautiful plush-seated car and placed
the boy where he could have a last look at his
friends, for Mr. and Mrs. Follet and Nancy stood on
the platform.</p>
<p>It was Nancy who held his eyes till the last moment,
little Nancy with two big tears dropping down
her cheeks. Steve&rsquo;s throat ached unaccountably.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>A TRIP TO THE CITY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk, as the train
thundered into the station at Louisville.
The ride of four hours had been a continued
kaleidoscopic delight. Steve could not understand
how it was that trees and houses went racing
by the car windows and Mr. Polk had rare enjoyment
in the boy&rsquo;s unsophisticated inquiry and comment.</p>
<p>Bringing this boy into the city was like giving
sudden sight to a child who had lived its life in
blindness. With keenest pleasure, Mr. Polk took
him into a brilliantly lighted restaurant for supper
and then afterwards up town by trolley into a large
furnishing establishment, for it was Saturday night
and the stores were open. There he fitted the little
fellow out from top to toe according to his liking,
the outfit including a shining German silver watch!
The two attracted attention everywhere, the boy&rsquo;s
face a study in its swiftly changing expression and
the man full of eager interest which he could not
curb.</p>
<p>When Steve was all dressed and stood before a
mirror, Mr. Polk exclaimed:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that is something like!&rdquo; And the boy
turning from the transformed vision of himself, lifted
a quivering face to his benefactor.</p>
<p>There was a delicately sensitive side to the nature
of this boy of the woods. To him this experience
was not simply getting new, fine clothes, but his old
familiar self seemed to go with the old clothes, and
like the chrysalis emerging into the butterfly, he
could not pass into the new life, which the new
type of clothes represented, without having his joy
touched with the pain of travail.</p>
<p>With the tenderness of a woman Mr. Polk put his
arm about the little fellow in quick contrition, knowing
that it had been too much for this habitant of the
quiet woods, and said in a most matter-of-fact way:
&ldquo;Now, son, for home and bed,&rdquo; and in a few minutes
more the boy was snugly tucked in bed in Mr. Polk&rsquo;s
comfortable bachelor quarters, and the next morning
when he woke he was a new boy inwardly as well as
outwardly.</p>
<p>He was ready for new &ldquo;thrills&rdquo; and they came.
After a very astonishing breakfast he went with Mr.
Polk to church. The beautiful building and wonderfully
dressed people held his wide-eyed interest, but
when the deep-toned organ poured forth its solemn
melody, big tears dropped down the boy&rsquo;s face and
Mr. Polk drew him within a protecting arm. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
like touching the quivering chords of a little bared
soul with new, strange harmonies, and the sensitive
heart of the man understood intuitively the boy&rsquo;s
mingled joy and pain.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Mr. Polk took his charge to the
home of a friend to see about schools, as his friend
had a boy about the same age, and also to get help
as to the general problem of caring for his prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p>
<p>Arrived at the house, the friend, Mr. Colton, his
wife and Maud, the young daughter about fifteen
years of age, were at home and gave the visitors a
lively welcome. They were at once greatly interested
in the mountain boy, but so civilized was his
outfit, and intelligent his face that they could not
realize his difference from themselves except when
he talked. This they were delighted to get him to
do, and he answered all questions unabashed, though
he liked better to look and listen.</p>
<p>The Coltons were well-to-do people with ever-ready,
easy hospitality and insisted that Mr. Polk
and Steve remain to tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maids are both out as it happens, so we
must get tea ourselves,&rdquo; said Mrs. Colton, adding
with mock graciousness, &ldquo;and everybody may help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all trooped out in responsive pleasantry
through the hall, and Mr. Colton inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Raymond?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is out,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Colton. &ldquo;There is
no telling when he will be in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That they were very indulgent parents and Raymond
was an exceedingly lively boy, Mr. Polk
already knew.</p>
<p>The hostess and her daughter exchanged glances
of sudden consternation when they reached the
dining-room, then burst into merriest laughter.</p>
<p>At last Mrs. Colton said between subsiding ripples,
&ldquo;Father, please go down in the basement and look
in the furnace and you&rsquo;ll find the baker with the cold
roast left from dinner! Mr. Polk, you go along too,
please, and you&rsquo;ll see some loose bricks between the
joists right under this dining-room window, and right
behind them is the bread-box which you can bring
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cake is up-stairs in the hat-box of my trunk
under lock and key,&rdquo; gaily put in Maud, &ldquo;and you
can come with me, Steve, and bring down the preserves
from under the bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the whole family were in gales of
laughter, and Steve was greatly puzzled at this new
phase of civilization. Mrs. Colton finally explained
that for a few Sundays past Raymond had been
carrying off everything there was to eat in the house,
and having &ldquo;spreads&rdquo; in the barn with his chums.
This time they determined to outwit him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>Mr. Polk joined heartily in all the merriment,
going after and bringing in provisions, but in his
heart he thought, &ldquo;This is the product of too much
opportunity&ndash;&ndash;give me my mountain boy every time.
If he doesn&rsquo;t outstrip this pampered son, I miss my
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later Raymond came in and dominated the
conversation at once, after the manner of too many
bright, confident children of modern city life. After
tea he took Steve in charge on a lively tour of exploration,
and Mr. Polk talked over his plans for his
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing you ought to do,&rdquo; said Mr. Colton
who was very clear-headed concerning everything
except his own son, &ldquo;is to put the boy in a mountain
college. He would be at a disadvantage among boys
of his age in town, and then you&rsquo;ve no way to take
care of him, travelling as you do. My wife
has a friend near here who is greatly interested
in a mountain college; just go over and see
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed good advice and Mr. Colton took
Mr. Polk and Steve over at once.</p>
<p>The lady came in and greeted them with gracious
cordiality, but when she learned their errand and
knew that one of the little mountain boys, to whose
welfare she had given so much thought, time and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
money, was before her, her eyes grew tender and
filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must go to our mountain college at once; the
school has just opened,&rdquo; she said. So they heard all
about the school and its opportunities. When she
had finished Steve spoke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all that jes&rsquo; fer mountain boys lack me?&rdquo;
This seemed beyond belief, but they assured him it
was.</p>
<p>Raymond had greatly enjoyed demonstrating the
mysteries of the telephone, electric lights and various
contrivances of his own to so totally unenlightened
and yet so appreciative an intelligence as Steve&rsquo;s,
while the quaint mountain speech interested and
amused him exceedingly. So when Mr. Polk and
the boy took leave of the Coltons for the night Raymond
secured a promise that Steve might attend
school with him next day. Mr. Polk would be busy
making arrangements for the few days&rsquo; holiday which
would be necessary to take Steve back to the mountains
and place him in school.</p>
<p>Promptly next morning Raymond arrived at Mr.
Polk&rsquo;s rooms for Steve and the boys started off together
like two comrades. It was Steve&rsquo;s first day
in a schoolroom, and eye and ear were on the alert,
taking in everything.</p>
<p>He was well dressed and with his intelligent face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
the other boys noted nothing unusual until the noon
hour when Raymond introduced his new specimen
with keen relish. He had no unkind intentions in
the sly winks he gave chosen comrades, but these
aroused the curiosity of his fellows, and when Steve
began to talk the boys awoke to lively possibilities.
One after another began to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do for fun down at Hollow Hut?&rdquo;
asked one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We uns didn&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; fer fun, &rsquo;cep&rsquo;in&rsquo; hunt
cotton tails, foxes an&rsquo; coons,&rdquo; answered the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you play football?&rdquo; asked some one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nuver hearn tell of it,&rdquo; said Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Du tell,&rdquo; returned another boy, venturing to fall
a little into the stranger&rsquo;s vernacular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever play tennis, shinny or baseball?&rdquo;
persisted some one else, and Steve replied politely
&ldquo;that nobody ever hearn o&rsquo; them things in Hollow
Hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys then began to venture more boldly into
imitations of Steve&rsquo;s speech while some got behind
him and doubled up in silent laughter. Raymond
looked on, feeling himself the hero of the day in having
furnished such a comedy.</p>
<p>Suddenly Steve turned, perhaps with some intuition
of what was going on, and with swift comprehension
knew that he was being made fun of. His face on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
the instant was electrified with wrath. He drew
himself up, and clenched his hands. Then in a
twinkling his coat and cap were upon the ground.
Taking the first boy at hand Steve dealt him a blow
from the shoulder with a lean, sinewy arm that sent
him spinning across the yard, and before any one
could realize what was happening three or four others
followed, and the rest, frightened at his fury, took to
their heels with speed.</p>
<p>Steve stood alone at last quivering from head to
foot; then calming slowly, he took his coat on his
arm, put on his cap and walked away, not knowing
whither he was going. But as he grew more quiet
he took his bearings, and his keen sense of direction
and good recollection of things they had passed in
going, led him without trouble back to Mr. Polk&rsquo;s
rooms.</p>
<p>Raymond was not a cad, and when he had time to
think was thoroughly ashamed of himself. He went
to the teacher and made confession; then as both
were afraid the boy might get lost or come to some
harm, he went at once on a search. He did not
dream that Steve could so directly find his way back,
and Raymond wandered about for hours in a fruitless
search, doing without his dinner. At last, frightened
and contrite, he went to Mr. Polk&rsquo;s office. Here the
confession was harder to make, but it came out in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
all its humiliating details. Having eased his conscience
he wound up with a burst of enthusiasm:
&ldquo;I tell you, Mr. Polk, Steve&rsquo;s got the stuff in him.
There isn&rsquo;t a fellow in school but thinks he is fine.
We didn&rsquo;t mean a thing by our fun, but he served us
just right, and every fellow wants to take his
paw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Polk said little but sending Raymond home
and promising to telephone later, he went directly to
his rooms, knowing Steve&rsquo;s keenly intuitive mind
better than Raymond. Though anxious until it was
proven true, Mr. Polk found Steve as he had expected,
seated in his rooms when he got there. But
he saw a most dejected little figure. The new clothes
were laid aside, the old mountain things were on,
and the boy&rsquo;s face was drawn and white, though he
fronted Mr. Polk sturdily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong in no town. I ain&rsquo;t got no town
ways. I&rsquo;ll jes&rsquo; go back to Hollow Hut and stay
thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Polk put his arm about the boy and gently
drew him to a seat. For some moments there was
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;did the trip over the
mountains from Hollow Hut to Mr. Follet&rsquo;s sometimes
seem hard for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit shore did,&rdquo; said the boy slowly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t give up the struggle, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Steve, still slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the journey of life is like that journey over
the mountains: it is often hard; there are things to
overcome and things to endure. You have started
now up the long, hard hill of learning, and I hope
you are not going to turn back at the laughter of a
few boys. You thrashed them out, I understand,&rdquo;
he went on, and his voice held a strong hint of satisfaction;
&ldquo;pass right on now, putting the incident
behind you just as you did each rocky summit you
mounted on that difficult journey. You must climb
to the top, son, understand; nothing short of that
will satisfy me!&rdquo; And he looked earnestly, almost
vehemently into the boy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The penetrating gaze was returned, but with a
puzzled, groping inquiry for his benefactor&rsquo;s full
intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer mean I mus&rsquo; larn as much as you know?&rdquo;
he asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More,&ndash;&ndash;infinitely more,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk with
energy. &ldquo;I have half-way climbed the mountain
of knowledge and success in life,&ndash;&ndash;I have even
stopped less than half-way,&rdquo; he corrected a little
bitterly, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; rousing himself, &ldquo;I want to begin
life over again in you, and nothing but the very top
of the mountain of success will ever satisfy me!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
He turned again to the boy with a deep, searching
gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a boy of your word,&rdquo; he went on after a
moment, &ldquo;that is what pleased me most about you,
and now at the very outset of this business of learning
and succeeding in life, I want your promise that
you will not halt before obstacles, but go to the
top!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was impelling enthusiasm as well as energy
in the resonant tones, and Steve&rsquo;s spirit kindled with
answering enthusiasm and a glimmering vision of
heights which he had not hitherto glimpsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll git ter the top, Mr. Polk,&ndash;&ndash;ef I don&rsquo;t die on
the way,&rdquo; he said with solemn earnestness.</p>
<p>It was a most unexpected, peculiarly intense moment
for both, and in the silence which followed, the
imagination of boy and man scaled lofty peaks, but
the mountain of material success which filled Mr.
Polk&rsquo;s vision was not the beautiful, mystic height
upon which the boy gazed, and neither dreamed of
the conflict which this fact was to bring about in
future years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God hath set eternity in the heart of man,&rdquo; and
the child of the woods felt the stirring of an eternal
purpose, undefined though it was. The glamour of
the world had long since intervened for the man.</p>
<p>The telephone rang noisily, having no respect for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
visions, and Mr. Polk rose to answer it while Steve
began at once to put on again the new clothes in
unconscious ratification of his solemn life-promise to
Mr. Polk.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Colton at the phone and she learned
with great relief that Steve had been found. She
insisted that Mr. Polk and the boy must come over
to supper, after which there would be a little impromptu
party of Raymond&rsquo;s friends for Steve.</p>
<p>The boy looked very sober when this announcement
was made to him, but Mr. Polk smiled and
said heartily, as he had already done to Mrs. Colton:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will go!&rdquo; And they went.</p>
<p>There was just a bit of awkwardness when the
boys came into the Coltons&rsquo; that evening and met
Steve once more, but Mr. Polk, with an adroit question,
started him to telling them about trapping
rabbits, chasing foxes and treeing coons while the
boys became so interested, including Steve himself,
that all unpleasantness was forgotten. Upon leaving,
each boy took Steve&rsquo;s hand with real respect
and liking, and Raymond expressed the general
sentiment when he exclaimed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day Mr. Polk and Steve started for the mountain
school. As they sat together on the train Steve
said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be larnin&rsquo; to do things jes&rsquo; like mammy
said fer me ter do. I wonder ef she will know.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk simply, but with a
gentle sympathy in his voice, which, whenever expressed
by look or tone, seemed to bring the boy
close to the heart of the man. Resting a moment
in this embrace, Steve asked a question which had
come to him several times. His father and all the
mature men he had known had been married,&ndash;&ndash;for
bachelors are rare in the mountains,&ndash;&ndash;why had Mr.
Polk no wife?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is ye woman dead, Mr. Polk?&rdquo; was the question
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mr. Polk, with a smile that flitted
quickly, &ldquo;she did not marry me at all, and so has
left me lonely all my life. I would have been a far
better man had she done so. As it is,&rdquo; and the
bitterness crept into his voice again, &ldquo;I stopped
half-way up the hill of success as I told you, and
threw my prospects away. That is why you are to
live my life over for me and bring success whether
or no.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>OPPORTUNITY</h3>
</div>
<p>Mr. Polk and Steve made their railroad
trip by night, and the sleeper with its rows
of shelf-like beds was a fresh experience
for the boy, but he climbed to the upper berth and
slept the sleep of healthy youth. They reached
L&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and the
sight of mountain and valley spread out before them
in purple beauty gave a strange thrill of joy to Steve.
The mountaineer&rsquo;s love of the mountains rushed
upon him after all his new, pleasant experiences with
a first consciously defined emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk, &ldquo;now the problem is how
we can cover that forty miles which lies between us
and our school.&rdquo; But just at that moment he spied
an old man helping a woman into a wagon, and at
once he stepped up, found they were fortunately going
to the same point, and would gladly take in two passengers
with the ready accommodation of mountain
people.</p>
<p>They travelled leisurely on and on, Steve seeing
things of a familiar type and Mr. Polk much that was
fresh and interesting. They stopped over night at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
little settlement and journeyed on again next day,
reaching their destination early in the evening. When
the group of school buildings came into view, the old
mountaineer pointed out the main building with its
tower, and told them which was the &ldquo;gals&rsquo; sleepin&rsquo;
place,&rdquo; and which &ldquo;the boys&rsquo; sleepin&rsquo; place,&rdquo; as he
termed the two dormitories. He drove directly to
the president&rsquo;s home, a little unpainted frame house.
They were cordially received, entertained at supper
and taken afterwards to the boys&rsquo; dormitory, where
Steve was given a room with several other boys.
Then they walked over to &ldquo;The Hall,&rdquo; as it was
called, and were introduced to the teachers, who were
gathering there for the study hour. They had met
several when a young woman&rsquo;s trim, slender figure,
with a decided air of the city about it, appeared in
the doorway, and the light from within lit up a pair
of clear, steady brown eyes, a pleasant mouth with
firmness lurking in the corners, and fluffy brown hair
put back in a roll from a very attractive face.</p>
<p>She stood a moment there in the doorway with a
casual glance for the strangers, then suddenly caught
her breath and went white, but instantly recovered
herself as the president, oblivious of any tragic moment
for her, turned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Grace Trowbridge; she came down
here all the way from New York City to teach mountain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
boys and girls,&ndash;&ndash;and she knows how to do it,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Trowbridge bowed and passed quickly within the hall.</p>
<p>Mr. Polk acknowledged the introduction with a
look on his face that Steve had never seen before,
and the boy felt somehow that his good friend had
become a stranger as they walked back to the boys&rsquo;
dormitory for the night. Next morning, too, something
had come between them, and when Mr. Polk
said he would leave that day instead of staying several
days, as he had intended, Steve could make no
reply.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Polk left, however, in giving final instructions
to his charge, the old kindly manner returned,
and as he said, &ldquo;I hope you will like it here,
son,&rdquo; the boy replied with his old freedom:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knows I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to like it, and that thar Miss
Grace Trowbridge is the nicest one of &rsquo;em all. She
used ter live in New York City, the president said,
whar you used ter live. Didn&rsquo;t you nuver know her
thar?&rdquo; he asked innocently, not yet comprehending
in the least city conditions.</p>
<p>Mr. Polk set his lips grimly and answered sternly:
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; as he mounted a mule to ride back the forty
miles to the nearest railroad station.</p>
<p>What was the matter again? The boy did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
know, and he felt as though a sudden chill had come
upon him. But a moment later Mr. Polk looked
down at him kindly, reached over, pressed his hand,
and said: &ldquo;Be a good boy,&rdquo; as he rode away on the
ambling mule.</p>
<p>So Steve began his school life. He went into the
second reader class, his opportunities at the Follets&rsquo;
having put him beyond the beginners. In his class
were children of all ages and mature men and women,
who were just getting their first opportunity to learn.
Steve was bright and quick, had a good mind, and
made rapid progress.</p>
<p>With the superior social advantages which he had
found along the way from Hollow Hut to the school,
the boy became a great ally of the teachers in the
battle for nightgowns, combs, and brushes for the
hair and teeth, also for white shirts, collars and neckties
on Sunday, which most of the boys thought
&ldquo;plum foolishness anyways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, fellows,&rdquo; Steve would say when he found
them turning in at night with soiled feet, coats and
trousers, &ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t the way ter git ter be president.&rdquo;
He organized a company of &ldquo;regulators&rdquo; in the boys&rsquo;
dormitory, and when any fellows turned in with soiled
feet, coats and trousers, Steve&rsquo;s shrill whistle summoned
the army and a lively pillow fight ensued
which was hard on the pillows but always brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
victory for nightgowns. And when a boy refused
to brush his hair in the morning the regulators invariably
caught him, and the penalty was a thorough
brushing down of his rebellious locks by at least
twenty-five sturdy young arms. Under such methods
the cause of nightgowns and brushes was made
to thrive.</p>
<p>There was another cause which was more difficult,
but which enlisted all Steve&rsquo;s best endeavour. Mountain
children are apt to know the taste of liquor from
babyhood, but Steve had never liked it and neither
had his mother. Occasionally parents, especially
fathers, when they visited the school would bring
the children bottles of &ldquo;moonshine&rdquo; to hide and
drink from as they pleased, and the teachers found
Steve a great helper, though his corps of &ldquo;regulators&rdquo;
could not always be relied upon.</p>
<p>In the midst of his interesting, new surroundings
Steve&rsquo;s mind often went back to the rock where Tige
lay and to the grave of his &ldquo;mammy.&rdquo; How pleased
she would be, he thought again and again,&ndash;&ndash;maybe
she was&ndash;&ndash;that he was where he could &ldquo;larn things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He soon began to write letters to Mr. Polk, and a
steady improvement was noted all winter in these
letters. There was always a great deal in them
about Miss Grace, for she seemed to make him her
special charge and the two were great friends. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
loved to walk in the woods and talk with Steve,
hearing him tell many interesting things which he
had learned from intimate association with birds and
animals. Sometimes she would take his hand at the
top of a hill and together they would race down,
laughing and breathless to the bottom. After such
a run, one day, they halted by the bank of a stream
beneath one of the grand old beeches for which Kentucky
is famous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Steve,&rdquo; she exclaimed enthusiastically,
&ldquo;what a beautiful old beech this is. How symmetrical
its giant trunk, how perfect its development of
each branch and twig, while it pushes up into the
sky higher than all its fellows, gets more sunshine
than all the rest, has the prettiest growth of ferns
and violets at its base,&ndash;&ndash;and I just know the birds
and squirrels love it best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Grace had a bubbling, contagious enthusiasm,
and Steve followed her expressive gestures as she
pointed out each detail of perfection with answering
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; She turned suddenly and bent her
eyes upon him with still more radiant emphasis. &ldquo;I
want you to be just such a grand specimen of a man!
Big and strong and well developed,&ndash;&ndash;pushing up
into the sky further than all the rest about you, getting
more sunshine than any one else&ndash;&ndash;making little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
plants to grow and blossom all about you and drawing
to you the sweetest and best in life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled back into her shining eyes, somewhat
bewildered, but with an earnest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shore will try, Miss Grace, but I don&rsquo;t know
just what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean I want you to study hard, to develop
every power of mind and body you have, and then,&ndash;&ndash;give
your life for the uplift of the children of the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not press him for a promise, nor linger
upon the subject, but the first dim outline of that
mystic height of the boy&rsquo;s vision had been traced.</p>
<p>Upon another walk which they took together
Steve asked Miss Grace how she happened to come
from her home way up in New York down to Kentucky
to teach mountain boys and girls, and she was
silent a moment, a look which he could not fathom
coming over her bright face. At last she said, &ldquo;I
was very foolish; I threw away happiness. Then I
heard of this work and came here that I might redeem
my life by making it useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something about this boy of the mountains
that made the telling of the simple truth the
natural thing; but startled at even so vague a revealing
of her bruised heart, she turned the talk quickly
to other things.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>A STARTLING APPEARANCE</h3>
</div>
<p>In the spring following came a great day for the
mountain school when some friends and benefactors
were coming. Great preparations were
made. The school about three hundred strong
fronted the main hall, and there was great waving of
small and large handkerchiefs in a genuine salute as
the visiting party drove up.</p>
<p>When the company had scattered a little after the
greeting, Steve suddenly felt an arm about him and
turning, found Mr. Polk smiling down upon him.
The boy was overjoyed and could only cling to his
hand, speechless for a moment. Mr. Polk had met
the visiting party on the train, among whom was the
lady who had told him of the school, and she would
take no refusal,&ndash;&ndash;he must go with them.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was a beautiful day for Steve and in his boyish
talk about his life and school he often spoke of Miss
Grace, but each time came that grim setting of Mr.
Polk&rsquo;s lips and the boy soon instinctively dropped
her name. The day was destined to be full of events,
some in honour of the visitors and some that were
totally unexpected.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>The speech of welcome from the school was made
by Stephen Langly. Miss Grace had told him to
say in his own words whatever was in his heart to
say. So the boy stepped out from the gathered
school, mounted a little platform and stood before
the assembled crowd unabashed, for the mountaineer
knows no embarrassment, while in simple good English
he thanked the generous friends and teachers for
what they were doing for mountain boys and girls.
As he stood there well dressed, erect, manly, he bore
little resemblance to the forlorn boy who had crept
away from his cabin home at Hollow Hut a year
before.</p>
<p>As the crowd dispersed a little after the speech-making,
in which several took part, Mr. Polk and
Steve walked away together and passed a group of
teachers and students of which the visiting lady of
Mr. Polk&rsquo;s acquaintance was the centre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Mr. Polk, please, and bring Steve to
see me,&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>Miss Grace Trowbridge was one of the group and
Mr. Polk halted reluctantly, but finally joined
them.</p>
<p>Before a word could be exchanged a tall, lank,
grim mountaineer slouched forward and laid a horny
hand upon Steve&rsquo;s shoulder. The startled boy looked
up to see his father standing beside him!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>The Kentucky mountain product, unlike any other
so-called shiftless man in the world, may idle his
days away with pipe and drink, but let a wrong, real
or fancied, be done him or his and in his thirst for
vengeance he is transformed. His energy, his perseverance,
his intelligence, his fury become colossal.
So, Jim Langly, convinced after months of waiting
and brooding that his boy had been enticed away by
the giver of the watch, had set out with a grim purpose
of finding boy and man which had been undaunted
by any obstacle. With slow but persistent
effort he had traced the child over mountain and
valley, often losing all clue, but never relaxing till at
last he had reached Mr. Follet and learned that the
boy was in school. From thence he easily made his
way to the school of Mr. Polk&rsquo;s selection, and, arriving
by strange providence upon a gala day, had
found the two objects of his search at the same
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found ye at last,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;an&rsquo; when
I set eyes on the man whut give ye that watch and
tolled my boy away from his home, I&rsquo;ll shoot him
down lack a dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Polk quietly walked out and said, &ldquo;I am your
man, Mr. Langly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; the enraged mountaineer yelled, and
jerking a pistol from his trousers pocket, he lifted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
and would have cocked it, but quick as a deer Grace
Trowbridge had stepped in front of Mr. Polk, protecting
him with her body, while Steve threw himself
on his father and screamed shrilly, dropping into
the speech of the mountains:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, oh, pappy, pappy, don&rsquo;t shoot him! He
nuver got me ter leave home; I went myself, and I&rsquo;ll
go back with yer and stay all my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frantically the boy clung to his father, pleading
pitifully, while Grace Trowbridge with all her
strength pushed Mr. Polk back among a quickly
gathering crowd. Others joined her, and in the excitement
of the moment, both she and Mr. Polk were
hurried into safety within one of the school buildings
and the door locked upon them.</p>
<p>The town constable was on the ground, for his
services were quite likely to be needed in any public
gathering, and before Jim Langly realized what was
happening, being wholly unfamiliar with the ways
of law and order, his pistol had been wrenched from
his hand (something unheard of in mountain ethics),
and he was hurried from the scene like an infuriated
lion made captive.</p>
<p>Breathless and spent, Grace Trowbridge found
herself looking into the face of her old lover when
the door was locked upon them. She stood an instant
like a frightened bird driven to cover, her eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
gazing into his, anxiety, relief, tragic intensity born
of but one emotion in her white quivering face,&ndash;&ndash;and
then the warm blood surged up with returning
realization of the years of estrangement between
them, and she wheeled for instant flight.</p>
<p>But the door was locked, and baffled she faced
him again, crying, &ldquo;Oh, Sam, let me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer he caught her in his arms and said,
&ldquo;Let you out, and away from me? Never! I shall
hold you fast instead. I love you, love you, love
you,&rdquo; he cried vehemently, &ldquo;and what is more, you
love me!&rdquo; He crushed her to him and the tense,
spent figure relaxed in his arms while love in full tide
swept over them, after six weary years of longing
and restraint. Their separation had followed a misunderstanding
which now did not even seem to
need explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; she cried at last, moving energetically
away from him, &ldquo;I can never give up these blessed
mountain children. You&rsquo;ll have to adopt every one
of them if you take me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said happily, &ldquo;just as many of
them as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly both remembered Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam, where is Steve? Do you suppose his
father has carried him off, and that we will never see
him again?&rdquo; she exclaimed in distress, and a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
moments later, when release came to them, their
first anxious inquiry was for the boy.</p>
<p>No one had seen or thought of him in the excitement,
and when the story of Jim Langly&rsquo;s arrest had
been told them, they searched the grounds and buildings
in great anxiety before they finally found Steve
in his room.</p>
<p>When Mr. Polk opened the door the boy stood
before him dressed in a little ragged shirt and old
pair of trousers he had worn for hunting and with
bared feet. The hopeless expression of the lost was
in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep my promise to you, Mr. Polk,&rdquo; he
said brokenly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ever climb that mountain
fer yer, but it is better fer me ter die on the way
than fer you to be killed.&rdquo; Correct speech had no
part in such despair.</p>
<p>Mr. Polk drew the boy to him while Miss Grace
stood without, her lips tremulous and eyes full of
tears. After a silent moment Mr. Polk led the boy
outside and put him in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are going to give you up?&rdquo;
Mr. Polk said, striding up and down the hall. &ldquo;Not
by a long shot,&rdquo; he went on with energy, and a conviction
for which he could not at the moment see any
tangible foundation. &ldquo;This is all going to be fixed
up,&ndash;&ndash;just leave everything to Miss Grace and me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>The boy shook his head. &ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t know pappy,&rdquo;
he said sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not,&rdquo; returned Mr. Polk cheerfully, &ldquo;but I
know Grace Trowbridge, and I am going to trust her
to keep you here. Do just as she says, son, and
everything will come right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left them to talk with the president of the
school. They discussed what should be done with
Jim Langly. Mr. Polk greatly regretted the man&rsquo;s
arrest, but was compelled to admit it could not have
been avoided. He begged, however, that prosecution
of the case be delayed until every effort could
be made to make Langly see that only good was
intended for his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I must relinquish all claim to the boy,&rdquo;
he said sadly, &ldquo;but we must by some means win the
father&rsquo;s consent that Steve remain here,&ndash;&ndash;that is the
important thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided that Mr. Polk should leave, as
his presence could only infuriate the man, and the
president gladly promised to do everything in his
power to win the father.</p>
<p>For a week Jim Langly remained in the lock-up
of the town. He had wrenched his back severely in
the struggle with his captors; then, like a caged lion
indeed, he had beaten the walls of his prison all night
without food or drink, and being a man of indolent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
habits, he collapsed utterly next morning. The
gaunt, haggard face with deep hollows beneath the
eyes, the giant figure lying helpless upon a rude
couch of the lock-up touched deeply the heart of
Grace Trowbridge when she went in to see him. In
his blind fury he had not noticed her especially the
day before; and when, without saying a word, she
stepped lightly across the room and reaching through
the iron bars closed a rude shutter to screen the glare
of the morning sun from his eyes, then gently adjusted
a pillow beneath his head and fed him a cup
of hot broth, he accepted it all like a wild, sick animal
which in its helplessness has lost all animosity to
man.</p>
<p>During the day she tended him unobtrusively, but
with infinite kindness, and next morning she found
him better, but still willing to accept her care. He
even watched her with a far-away interest as one
would something unknown and yet strangely pleasing.
By the third morning she talked to him a bit
as she smoothed his pillow, and smiled as he ate her
toast with relish.</p>
<p>At last he said with an effort, &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s Steve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here,&rdquo; she said gladly, &ldquo;just waiting outside
the door for you to ask for him. He has been
there every day,&rdquo; she added softly.</p>
<p>Then she stepped to the door and motioned for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Steve. The boy came in, still dressed in mountain
fashion, for no amount of persuasion could induce
him to again put on the better clothes. This evidently
met the father&rsquo;s approval, for a look of bitter
expectancy which had come into his face faded at
once as he saw the old trousers and bare feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set down,&rdquo; he commanded feebly, but not unkindly,
though he had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>The two stayed with him through the day, and
gradually Grace, with consummate tact, made conversation
which included the three, though Langly took
little part. Then she read a stirring story which
compelled his attention and interest even though
he had never heard anything read aloud before. It
was the first time in the mountaineer&rsquo;s long life that
he had ever been unable to rise from his bed and go
his way and the helplessness had softened his spirit
like the touch of a fairy&rsquo;s wand. As he listened to
the sweet, cultured voice of the woman while she
read and saw Steve with quickened intelligence following
every word, he realized for the first time that
the world held strange things in which he had no
part, but for which his boy was ready.</p>
<p>At last Miss Grace turned to Steve and said in the
most natural manner, &ldquo;My throat is getting tired;
won&rsquo;t you read a little for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked at his father in quick alarm, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the gaunt face betrayed nothing, and the reading
went on in Steve&rsquo;s boyish voice.</p>
<p>Several days passed during which Miss Grace and
Steve had been constantly with the prisoner, then
his injured back was sufficiently restored to permit of
his being raised in bed to a sitting posture, and Miss
Grace felt it was time she tried to win his consent to
Steve&rsquo;s remaining at school. With woman&rsquo;s intuition
she divined the best method of approach. Steve
was not there and she told with simple pathos of the
boy&rsquo;s love for his mother. Jim Langly had loved
his wife with all the mountain man&rsquo;s lack of expression,
but the natural portrayal of the boy&rsquo;s affection
did not displease him. The old self in fact seemed
to pass out with that day of terrible fury and the
softer spirit which had taken its place seemed to
linger. She went on to tell how the boy&rsquo;s mother
had longed for him to have a chance to learn, and
that only a few minutes before her death she had
made him promise to go where he could learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this,&rdquo; she ended, &ldquo;which made Steve leave
home and not the man who sent the watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Langly lay silent a long while after hearing
this, and then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was agin that in her alive, I reckon I won&rsquo;t be
agin her dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little he inquired with resentment in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
voice, &ldquo;How come that man whut give him the
watch ter be with him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy happened to find the man,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and the man was good to him when he needed a
friend. But we will get Steve to tell us all about it,&rdquo;
she ended brightly, as Steve came just then to the
door. And with a glad heart the boy told all his
story from the day he left Hollow Hut till his father&rsquo;s
appearance a few days before.</p>
<p>The president of the school then visited Langly,
told of the boy&rsquo;s progress and begged earnestly that
he be allowed to stay. Nothing was said as to how
the boy&rsquo;s expenses were to be met, and since Jim
Langly knew as little as a child about the cost of
such things, he asked no questions. When strong
enough at last Langly walked out a free man, the
president having withdrawn all charges against him,
and after looking about the buildings with strange
interest he started back to Hollow Hut, with no
good-bye for his boy after the manner of the mountains,
but with an understanding that when school
closed Steve should return to his old home for the
summer.</p>
<p>It was some two months later when Mr. Polk
carried out this promise which had been made the
father, by taking the boy back to the woods where
they had first met. He expected to camp there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
for a few days&rsquo; fishing, and to arrange for Steve&rsquo;s
safe return to the school in the fall, as happy plans of
his own for the autumn would probably prevent his
coming in person.</p>
<p>When Steve left Mr. Polk he swung off down the
well-remembered mountainside with strange joy in
his heart. He had felt a new kinship for his father
growing upon him since he could remain at school
in the freedom of parental consent, and shy thought
had come of reading aloud sometimes in the old
Hollow Hut cabin from the pile of books under his
arms while his father smoked and listened, as he had
in the beautiful days when Miss Grace had tended
him.</p>
<p>But a few hours later he came slowly back up the
same path with a stricken look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pappy&rsquo;s dead, too,&rdquo; he said brokenly, when Mr.
Polk stepped forward in surprise and alarm to meet
him.</p>
<p>The boy sat down upon a log, dropping his books
in a heap beside him, and his bent shoulders shook
with sobs.</p>
<p>Mr. Polk comforted him with silent tenderness for
a time, then gradually drew out the story of Jim
Langly&rsquo;s short illness of a week from a virulent
fever and his burial two days before.</p>
<p>Together they went again next day to the cabin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Mirandy had married a few weeks previous and she
and her husband were beginning family life anew in
the old place. She had been stirred somewhat by
the events of the year, and looked with interest upon
Mr. Polk and Steve, the latter showing plainly to her
the touch of new surroundings, and when Mr. Polk
told her he wanted to take the boy for his own and
educate him, she said with a touch of bitterness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tek him erlong; he won&rsquo;t nuver know nothin&rsquo;
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the two who had seemed bound from the first
by close ties went away together, Steve to spend the
summer at the school, where a few were always accommodated
during the vacation, and Mr. Polk to
wind up his business affairs in the South preparatory
to a return to New York. He had formerly been
associated with an uncle having large railroad interests
in the East, who had often urged his return.
He now proposed to do so, taking advantage of
opportunities still open to him. These had been
thrown away upon the breaking of his engagement
with Grace Trowbridge, six years before, to take a
position with a southern railroad and wander restlessly
among new scenes.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<h3>STEVE DEVELOPS A MIND OF HIS OWN</h3>
</div>
<p>In the autumn Mr. Polk&rsquo;s happy plans materialized.
There was a wedding in a handsome
New York City home, and Steve Langly arrived
the day before for the festivities. At the ceremony
he and Anita Trowbridge, the little sister of Miss
Grace, were the attendants. They came in first, Steve
dressed as a page in a velvet suit which went well
with his clear, dark complexion, and little Nita, as
she was called, tripped beside him in delicate pink as
a fairy flower girl. They stood on either side of a
beautiful fox-skin rug with a history, upon which the
bride and groom, slowly following, took their places
to repeat the sacred vows which bound them for
life.</p>
<p>Steve and Nita, as the only children, spent the
evening together, roaming about the house, Steve
finding new interests everywhere. He looked around
at the rich furnishings and beautiful floral decorations
with appreciative eyes, seeming not at all out
of place in such surroundings. A feeling of awkwardness
and timidity might have possessed so poor
a boy reared anywhere else, but mountain-born as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
was, he accepted man&rsquo;s magnificence with the same
tranquil spirit that he did the shimmering silver of a
mountain sunrise or the gorgeous colour-triumph of its
sunset. But he did not understand Nita. She tried
her most grown-up ways upon him, chatting after the
manner of a little society belle, and while she was so
pretty that he loved to look at her as he would have
looked at a beautiful flower, he did not know what to
say to her. Having talked of many things, and
being an ardent little lover of pretty clothes, taken in
with appreciative eyes the handsome costumes of the
guests, she sighed at last and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just love to go down Broadway, don&rsquo;t you,
and see all the handsome gowns on people as they
pass, and look in at the store windows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I nuver was there,&rdquo; he answered
with a touch of his mountain speech, and then she
laughed a silvery, childish laugh and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You funny mountain boy,&rdquo; in a natural, frank
way that made Steve smile back and feel more at
ease.</p>
<p>After this they got on well as a couple of children,
while Nita often exclaimed, &ldquo;You funny mountain
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Polk called him their boy with a new
sense of parentage after their marriage, and wanted to
make him legally their son, but when it was proposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
that he be known in the future as Stephen Polk, he
looked far off into space a moment, and then as
though his spirit had winged its way back into the
wilderness of its birth, he dropped into the old manner
of speech and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank yer, but I was born Langly, an&rsquo; I think I
ought ter die Langly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said no more, and soon decided to send him
back to the mountain school for his preparatory work
at least, largely because Mrs. Polk was strongly convinced
this was best for the boy; so, during the next
six years, he spent the school terms in the mountains
and his vacations in the north with his foster-parents.
The last two summers he took work in a
city university with special courses in geology and
mining engineering, for Mr. Polk, knowing the rich
treasures stored in the Kentucky mountains, had brilliant
plans for Steve&rsquo;s future, dreaming of a time
when the boy should be able to link these treasures
with northern capital.</p>
<p>Mrs. Polk&rsquo;s dreams were of another sort altogether.
She never lost interest in the cause of education in
these same Kentucky mountains, and many were the
talks she and Steve had about the progress being
made there and the needs constantly developing.
Engrossed in business, as Mr. Polk came more and
more to be, he took no note of his wife&rsquo;s indirect influence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
while she did not realize that she was interfering
with plans of his.</p>
<p>As Steve grew to young manhood Mr. Polk asked
him as often as studies would permit in summer to
go down to the office. He liked to give the boy a
taste of the financial whirl, and it was intensely interesting
and exciting to Steve. He felt something of
the same tremor of wonder and delight over the inner
whirl of gigantic machinery moving railroad systems
which stirred him when he felt the first rush of a
passing railroad train, and there was a certain eager
desire to be a part of it all.</p>
<p>It was upon his sixth vacation visit that Mr. Polk
turned to him one day at the office as the boy&rsquo;s eyes
glistened with interest and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall want you at my elbow in a few years now.
I shall be too old after a while to do all the things
waiting to be done, and you remember your promise
to climb that mountain of success for me whose
heights I never shall be able to reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the youth of nineteen suddenly looked afar as
the boy of thirteen had done when it was proposed
that he change the old name of Langly, and a vision
of rugged mountains and deep valleys which again
spread out before him were tracked by eager bared
feet of poorly clad children hurrying towards the few
schools which here and there dotted the wilderness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
He was silent, for a definite conflict had begun in his
soul.</p>
<p>Mr. Polk noticed the silence, and with a restless
energy which was growing upon him, said to his
wife that evening when they were alone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Grace, I am uncertain about Steve.
That boy&rsquo;s unfathomable. Here I have been counting
upon his going into business, and I know business
appeals to him for I can see it in his eye, and
yet when I spoke to him definitely to-day he just
looked off into space,&rdquo; he ended in disgust.</p>
<p>Mrs. Polk laughed. &ldquo;Well, you know, I have
never been an enthusiast over money-making, and I
don&rsquo;t believe Steve ever will be,&ndash;&ndash;though he may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look here,&rdquo; her husband said impatiently,
&ldquo;if he gets a good knowledge of geology and mining
engineering, as I mean he shall, he can locate
and open up some good mines in those Kentucky
mountains which will make us all rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Polk again, &ldquo;that doesn&rsquo;t stir
me a bit. But when I think of every little yearning
child of the mountains well shod, with a clean kerchief
in its pocket, and trudging away to school
frosty mornings, then I begin to thrill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk with impatient energy;
&ldquo;but money will help bring that to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it isn&rsquo;t money alone that is necessary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
They need an apostle of education, one of their
very own who shall go among them opening their
eyes to the world of knowledge and opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would like our Steve to be that apostle,
as you call him, I suppose.&rdquo; Looking at her intently
a moment, he softened and added, &ldquo;Well, you are a
dear, unworldly woman.&rdquo; Then in sudden justification
of himself, he went on: &ldquo;I am willing he should
be an apostle too, but one with money, so he can
bring things to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he said no more to his wife, neither did he
trouble Steve in the least with definite propositions
for the future, but in the late summer of that year he
remarked in a matter-of-fact way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Steve, it must be college now for the next
two years at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon Steve looked very sober and finally
said: &ldquo;Mr. Polk, you have been so good to me I
cannot even talk about it. I do want to go to college
more than I can express, but great, strapping
fellow that I am, I ought not to accept your generosity
any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, son,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk, with the tenderness
he had given the little boy years before, &ldquo;I want to
do for you as I would for my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve said huskily, &ldquo;I appreciate it deeply, but you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
know I couldn&rsquo;t give up my name, and it is just as
hard for me to give up my independence. If I go
to college at your expense it must be with the distinct
understanding that I am to repay every penny
spent for me. Forgive me,&rdquo; he added with a smile,
&ldquo;I suppose it is my mountain blood that makes me
want to be free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Polk, looking at the strong young face, knew
that he must yield, and so the money was advanced
for Steve&rsquo;s college expenses with the understanding
that it was a loan.</p>
<p>The two college years were busy and profitable
ones for Steve. He was fond of study and the regular
courses of the school led him into new lines of
interest while he still pursued his specialties of
geology and mining engineering. The companionship
of young men and women of inherited culture
and opportunity of the best type was broadening
and a fine means of general culture for him. Among
the young women with whom he was thrown there
developed no special interest for him, though he
often wondered why. He, however, came to smile
as he questioned his own heart or was questioned by
chums, while he said, &ldquo;We of mountain blood are
slow, you know,&rdquo; and he failed to note how certain
memories of soft yellow curls above a little white
pinafore were so sacred that he never mentioned them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>He matured greatly in the two years, and at
twenty-one was broad-shouldered from college athletics,
six feet two in height, and his abundant dark
hair with a suggestion of curl at the ends crowned a
fine, clean-cut, somewhat slender face which in repose
was serious, but possessed of a hidden smile
which had formed the habit of flashing out suddenly,
transforming his face with a peculiar radiance.</p>
<p>For the Christmas holidays of his last year at college
he went home to the Polks as usual and one
evening sat at the opera beside Nita Trowbridge in a
little family party which included her. During all
his comings and goings of the school years he had
seen Nita with almost the familiarity of a brother.
She was the child of middle age, petted and spoiled
and much of a society butterfly as she developed into
young ladyhood, though a very lovable one. Mr.
and Mrs. Polk were greatly attached to her, and
though it had not been hinted at, Steve knew that
Mr. Polk would like nothing better than that they
should marry when he was established in business.
How Mrs. Polk would feel about it he was not so
sure. Perhaps she doubted their congeniality of
tastes.</p>
<p>As Nita sat beside him on this evening she
watched Steve&rsquo;s rapt enjoyment of Wagner&rsquo;s beautiful,
weird melodies. Between acts she said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How intensely you enjoy music!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he returned, throwing off the spell with
an effort, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; And then with a reminiscent
flash the smile broke over his face. &ldquo;I remember
well where I heard the first music of my life. It
was when I was twelve years old, and from a mountain
fellow who had had no training. But he simply
made the banjo talk, as the darkeys would say, and
reproduced with skillful touch and thrilling voice a
fox hunt which fairly set me crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the next,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;was at a church,
just a little later, and never will I forget how the
deep-toned organ stirred my soul to the very depths.&rdquo;
There was a quiet solemnity upon him as he said
this which Nita did not break for a moment. Then
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How barren the mountains must be! You will
never want to go there again, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barren!&rdquo; he exclaimed in return. &ldquo;I wish I
were an artist in word painting and I would make
mountain peak after mountain peak glow with rhododendron
and laurel, fill the valleys with silver sunrise-mist
to glorify their verdure for you, and then
call out all the fur and feathered folk and troops of
mountain children from their forest homes. You
would not think it a barren country,&rdquo; he concluded
with smiling eloquence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;but to think of
no good music, no pleasures, no,&ndash;&ndash;anything that
makes up our delightful living here,&rdquo; she ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he responded gravely, adding
almost to himself, &ldquo;but it must be carried to them
through work and sacrifice by somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then becoming conscious the next instant of the
brilliant scene about him his smile flashed over his
face again and he turned to her with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, did you see an account in the papers
of the wreckage of a car load of millinery in the
Kentucky mountains a few days ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not,&rdquo; she smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was a railroad wreck somewhere up
there and a whole car load of millinery was sent out
upon the four winds of heaven. Big hats and little,
such as women know all about and men can&rsquo;t even
talk of, with all sorts of gorgeous flower trimmings,
feathers and ribbons were scattered through the
woods, and they say barefooted mountain women
flocked from every direction and decked themselves
in the latest styles of head-gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both laughed over the picture and Steve added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would only need a procession of
fashionable gowns parading the mountains to transform
our women, while the sight of swallow-tails and
silk hats might do as much for the men, for like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
rest of the world we take up the superficial with
ease, but&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;sobering again&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to give our people a
glimpse into the knowledge contained in books, to
waken us to life&rsquo;s highest harmonies and open our
eyes to nature&rsquo;s beautiful hidden colours, is going to
take a long time, and as I said, somebody must work
and sacrifice for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He searched the beautiful face beside him for
sympathetic understanding, but she only looked at
him with wide eyes as the frivolous little girl had
done years before, not comprehending, while she
wanted to say again, this time a little wistfully, &ldquo;You
funny mountain boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No conception of life translated into labour and sacrifice
for others, such as he had begun to battle with,
had ever come within her range of thought, and the
starting of the music again was welcome to them both.</p>
<p>At the end of two years Steve was graduated, having
been thoroughly prepared upon entering college,
and when he returned to his foster-parents at the
close of school they were greatly pleased with their
boy. On the second night after his arrival Mr. Polk
sat with him after dinner and smoked in great satisfaction.
But it was of short duration. Steve had had a
letter from his alma mater, the Kentucky mountain
school, asking him to return as a teacher there the
next year, putting forth strongly the need and opportunity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
for good. He had waited to talk the
matter over with Mr. and Mrs. Polk before deciding,
though it was pretty well settled in his own mind.
He handed the letter to Mr. Polk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will not go,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk, with
decision, as soon as he had finished it. &ldquo;There is an
opening for you in the office and I am anxious for
you to take hold at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve looked afar again, as he had twice before
when his fate was about to be settled for him, and
Mr. Polk stirred impatiently. But the younger man
turned at once, this time with that sudden smile
upon his face, and said ingratiatingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Polk, I am afraid I haven&rsquo;t any head for
business,&ndash;&ndash;I love books far better. I feel a premonition
that I shall be stupid in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk, with quick irritation.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. You have never been stupid
about anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; Steve replied, serious again. &ldquo;I
have not been tried, I admit, and I must confess that
business had a certain fascination for me as I have
watched things stir in your office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Polk. &ldquo;I
have seen it in your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; said Steve as promptly, and with a
compelling earnestness in his voice that made the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
older man hold himself in restraint. &ldquo;Mr. Polk, I
must tell you something before we go any further in
this matter. My barren boyhood has never faded
from my mind. I cannot put it from me. I live
it again in the thought of every little child hidden
away in the mountains in ignorance and squalor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be little ones of my own blood in the
Hollow Hut home,&rdquo; he added, and his voice dropped
into a deep intensity which held them both motionless
for a moment; then, for relief, breaking it again
with that smile, he said: &ldquo;I suppose it is the survival
of our feudal mountain blood in me which
makes me ready to go back to fight, bleed and die
for my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is simply a Quixotic idea you have gotten into
your head that you should go back to the mountains
and spend your life trying to help your people,&rdquo;
Mr. Polk replied emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny you may be right,&rdquo; said Steve patiently,
&ldquo;but I got the idea fixed when I was a boy
there at school having privileges which were denied
so many, and you know one is very impressionable
in early youth, and I confess that though for many
pleasant reasons I have wanted to shake it off, I have
been unable to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This roused Mr. Polk to instant combat. He rose
and strode the floor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Polk stood in the doorway an instant just
then, but wisely and noiselessly slipped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right to want to help your own, but
the practical way to do it is with money,&rdquo; he said
vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not entirely sure,&rdquo; returned Steve slowly.
&ldquo;I confess I may be mistaken&ndash;&ndash;but I have thought
and thought over this ever since you first proposed
two years ago that I should go into business with
you, and though, as I have said, I am still uncertain,
I believe I ought to go there and work for my
people. It will be ten years at least before I can do
much in a monetary way, but I can begin teaching
at once. Besides,&rdquo; he hurried on before Mr. Polk
could speak, &ldquo;people there need indoctrination,&ndash;&ndash;inoculating
so to speak, with the idea of education as
much as they need money, and no one can do this
so well as one of their own. Thanks to you, the
best friend any boy ever had,&rdquo; he went on, his voice
breaking a little, &ldquo;I have had advantages which have
fallen to the lot of few mountain boys, and I feel that
my responsibility is tremendous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk, &ldquo;but I do not agree with
you as to the best way of meeting it. However,&rdquo; he
ended hotly, &ldquo;I see you are like most young men of
to-day whatever their obligations, you do not wish
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>Steve was deeply hurt. &ldquo;Mr. Polk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
would rather give my right arm than have anything
come between us. If it were a matter of personal
ambition, I would yield at once to your good judgment,
but&ndash;&ndash;please understand,&ndash;&ndash;let me make this
clear,&ndash;&ndash;I am not sure that going myself to work
among my people is the best way, but I simply feel
it should be tried first. If I should remain here a
while, I know I would never go there, and if I find
that I am wrong in going, at the end of two years I
will gladly return to you for business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go, Steve Langly, contrary to my advice
and better judgment, you go for good,&rdquo; said Mr.
Polk sternly, pausing in his striding and emphasizing
with a stamp of his foot.</p>
<p>Mr. Polk with his gentleness had always had a
hot-headed, unreasonable side to his nature. It was
seldom in evidence, but it had shown itself years
before in his break with his sweetheart and it was
showing itself again with the boy whom he loved
most devotedly.</p>
<p>Steve bowed his head in silent, dignified acceptance.
Following a forceful law of human nature this
unreasonable resistance (as he saw it) was fixing him
very firmly in his own resolution. But the thought of
all the older man had been to him rushed upon him
again with softening effect, and he said sadly at last:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know how to make you understand,
Mr. Polk,&ndash;&ndash;but this need to go back to my own and
try to help them is something inborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk curtly. &ldquo;It is
the mountain shiftlessness in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve rose with flashing eyes and heaving breast,
but remembering again, he controlled himself, and
sat down. His voice was cool and crisp, however,
as he said a moment later:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of forgetting my debt to you,
Mr. Polk, and you have a right to know what are
my prospects for paying it.&rdquo; He named his salary,
which was very meagre, and then added, &ldquo;But my
wants will be few,&ndash;&ndash;and I have found that my pen
promises to be a pretty good earning implement.&rdquo;
This he added with reluctance, for he had not meant
to tell it. &ldquo;I shall pay you as soon as possible,&rdquo; he
ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk again curtly,
and strode this time out of the room for the night.</p>
<p>Steve soon followed, going to his room with a
sense of desolation that was akin to the desolation
of his boyhood in the wilderness. He felt that he
must leave New York at once, for he could not stay
longer with self-respect under the roof which had
been home to him for so many years. What &ldquo;little
mother,&rdquo; as he had come to call Mrs. Polk, would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
say he did not know, but his heart warmed when he
thought of her, and comforted at last by the feeling
that she at least would not misunderstand him, he
fell asleep towards morning. And in his fitful
dreaming her sweet face was strangely crowned with
soft yellow curls and she wore a little white pinafore!</p>
<p>The next day Steve had a long talk with Mrs.
Polk. She had heard of the trouble from Mr. Polk,
and had done all in her power to bring about a
change in his state of mind. Failing utterly and
knowing his tenacity when an idea was once fixed,
she could not encourage Steve with the hope of
any immediate change. Neither could she urge the
young man to abandon his purpose, for she felt that
he alone must decide his future, and though in her
heart she approved his course, so deeply was she
grieved over the alienation between him and Mr.
Polk that she held it in restraint. She knew that
she had helped to shape his determination, and
woman-like was fearful now she had made a mistake.</p>
<p>When Steve said that he must go, she did not try
to keep him, but her eyes were brimming with tears
when he tenderly kissed her good-bye, as he had
always been in the habit of doing, and she pressed a
roll of money in his hand, whispering, &ldquo;It is my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, little mother,&rdquo; he said with determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
good cheer, &ldquo;I do not need it. I was very economical
the last few weeks at school, for I had forebodings
of trouble; then,&ndash;&ndash;I earned some money
writing little stories for boys, the past year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely noticing the last remark she hesitated a
moment, wanting to insist that he take it, and yet
reluctant. Then she held him by the shoulders with
her slender hands, and said earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever need, you will let me know, will you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will, dearest little mother in the
world,&rdquo; he said, his own eyes glistening with tears.</p>
<p>There was a formal leave-taking with Mr. Polk at
the office, and then he went his way back to the
mountains of his birth.</p>

<a name='XI_EXPERIENCE' id='XI_EXPERIENCE'></a>
<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
</div>
<p>As the train carrying Steve southward reached
a point where rugged peaks began pushing
majestically up into the distant firmament
he felt again the old thrill of the mountaineer&rsquo;s love
of the mountains, while his trained eye noted with
keen pleasure new details of line and colour. Then,
when the railroad trip was over and he neared the
end of the forty-mile wagon ride, bringing the little
tower surmounting &ldquo;The Hall&rdquo; of his alma mater in
sight once more, his face lit up with tender joy, for
the old place had meant more to him than schools
do to the average boy. Sweeping his eye back over
a landscape where purple heights were tipped with
sunset gold in the distance, giant beeches held aloft
their summer leafage in the valleys and mountain
flower-favourites bloomed in glorious June profusion
everywhere, he inwardly exclaimed, with sudden
reverence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is God&rsquo;s part, the fashioning of this beautiful
setting,&rdquo; and then turning again to the group of
school buildings, &ldquo;and this is man&rsquo;s,&ndash;&ndash;the bringing
of humanity into harmony with the perfection of His
handiwork.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>He had been unable to throw off entirely the
depression which had followed the rupture with Mr.
Polk, and deeply stirred emotionally as he had been
in parting with Mrs. Polk, it required this spiritual
interpretation of school life to restore his equilibrium.</p>
<p>But the battle involved in the step he had taken
was by no means fought in that one flash of high conception.
Being a wholesome, normal fellow with an
ordinary amount of selfish desire for comfort (though
he had seemed to follow a Quixotic idea into the
wilderness), he found himself at once missing the
luxuries of life to which he had become accustomed.
All through the summer he travelled about on
horseback,&ndash;&ndash;sometimes on foot,&ndash;&ndash;stopping often at little
squalid cabins, and often also at meagre homes where
housewives wrung his heart with their pathetic effort
to be thrifty and cleanly on almost nothing, and
everywhere he tried to inoculate the people with the
idea of education. On the whole his experience
proved more of a hardship than he had believed possible
with his early mountain bringing up. He discovered
that he had a decided liking for individual towels,
and was quite capable of annoyance when obliged to
bathe his face in a family tin wash-pan,&ndash;&ndash;or temporarily
idle skillet where wash-pans were unknown,&ndash;&ndash;while his
predilection for a bath tub with hot and cold water
on tap had become more fixed than he had suspected.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Have I already grown too fastidious to be helpful
to my own people?&rdquo; he asked himself in disgust.
Then he squared his shoulders and set his lips in fresh
determination. But, a moment later, with that sudden
smile upon his face, he also resolved to compromise
a bit with hardship. He stopped at the first wayside
store and invested in towels which he learned to wash
and dry at convenient times. This gave him pleasant
independence, and since his bedroom had always
been fixed in the open,&ndash;&ndash;for from the first he could
not bring himself to sleep in crowded rooms where
whole families took their rest,&ndash;&ndash;he could make his
morning toilet without offense to his hosts, while a
soapy plunge in some mountain stream became a
luxury he would not readily forego. And always,
whatever the hardship, there was the compensation
of barefooted boys and girls held spellbound, and
often fathers and mothers as well, while he unfolded
the wonders of a world which lay beyond the mountain&rsquo;s
rim, and always he had the advantage of being
able to assure them that he, too, was mountain bred.</p>
<p>So, with contending against many things distasteful
on one side, and exhilaration while little hands
clung to his as his had clung to Mr. Polk&rsquo;s that long
ago day in the heights about Hollow Hut, the summer
passed and he began his work as teacher.</p>
<p>He had long known that he would enjoy teaching,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
and took up his duties with keen interest. Fortunately
for him he had little conceit or pedantry,
which would have been a fatal handicap for him as
teacher among his own people, simple-hearted though
they were. He organized his work with straightforward
earnestness and quiet ability and things usually
moved smoothly in his class room. But many old
difficulties in the life of the school with which he had
seen the teachers battling when he was a pupil
promptly presented themselves afresh to test the tact,
skill and wisdom of the young teacher. Some boys
still came to school with well-developed taste for tobacco
and liquor which parents still indulged, and
passing mountaineers often good-naturedly fostered.
Having helped to battle with these things as a boy
he knew somewhat how to handle them. But another
matter of which he took little note in his student
days, but which had nevertheless always been a difficult
problem, was love-making in the school. He
was sorely puzzled how to wisely handle this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little mother,&rdquo; he wrote Mrs. Polk, &ldquo;my chief
difficulty is laughable in a sense, but from another
point of view it is really a stupendous problem! One
old mountaineer said to me last summer, &lsquo;Them
schools is the courtin&rsquo;est places in the world.&rsquo; I begin
to think he was right, and it is not always the
superficial flirting and love-making which is a part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
your coeducational schools,&ndash;&ndash;a thing simply trivial
and naughty,&ndash;&ndash;but often tragic passion instead, quite
in harmony with the title of Dryden&rsquo;s play, &lsquo;All for
Love, or the World Well Lost&rsquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, these children of the woods hear the call
to mate as naturally as the birds in the trees, and
knowing nothing of Fifth Avenue brown stone fronts
or cozy cottages at Newport, they want to leave
school, gather twigs and build their nests at once.
And sometimes one feels as guilty in breaking up
such prospective nests as when molesting a pair of
birds!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I getting to be something of a sentimentalist?
Well, I assure you I am not going to let it grow upon
me. I bear sternly in mind that, like the first pair of
human beings in the Garden of Eden, they have really
eaten of the tree of knowledge and know some things
which they ought not to know,&ndash;&ndash;having some secrets
from the rest of mankind which are not at all good
for them,&ndash;&ndash;while the things they need to know for
higher, better living are so numerous, that I ruthlessly
break the tenderest hearts, and insist on study
and discipline; for nothing but education, mental,
moral and spiritual, will ever bring the greatest people
in the world, the people of the Kentucky mountains,
into their just inheritance! You see how completely
identified I am again when I indulge in Kentucky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
brag,&ndash;&ndash;which is not so different after all from
the brag of other sections, and I promise not to let
this grow upon me either, for work and not brag is
before me, as you know. I want you to see, however,
that I continue to feel the mountaineer is worth
working for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to return to the love-making. Tragedy and
comedy are in evidence enough to lure me into the
field of romance, but the practical hindrances to daily
school work are too absorbing for great indulgence
of my pen. Ardent swains pay open court to their
sweethearts, promenading halls and grounds together
and even pressing suit in the class room! While
frequently the crowning difficulty in the whole matter
is the pleased approval of parents! Early marriage,
you know, is most common in the mountains,
girls of twelve and thirteen often taking up the duties
of wives and the great desire of parents for their
daughters is usually to get them early married off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&ndash;&ndash;I suspect this is all familiar to you,&rdquo; he
reminded himself, &ldquo;and still I must tell it to you,&ndash;&ndash;and
let you laugh over a recent experience I have
had with a pair of lovers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure that I have lectured most earnestly
and scientifically upon the evils of tobacco and
liquor for the young, and also have set forth as tactfully
and convincingly as I know how the fact that a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
school is not the place for lover-like attentions, beseeching
them to give themselves wholly to the business
of acquiring knowledge while they are here,
with all the eloquence of which I am capable. But,
in spite of this, as I was leaving my recitation room
at the close of school a few days ago I noticed a girl,
Alice Tomby, lingering with Joe Mott, one of her
admirers, and stepping outside I found another admirer
of hers standing beneath a near-by tree, with
clenched fist and blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that a typical mountain tragedy was quite
possible and stopping casually a moment to look at
my watch, I turned and went back to find the girl
and her beau in a most lover-like attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I threw my shoulders out to their broadest, and
walked with all the dignity I could summon to my
desk where I stood before them a moment in silence.
Their sheepish faces were a study for the cartoonist,
and I wanted to laugh more than I can tell you, but
I finally said gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Tomby and Mr. Mott&rsquo; (the use of the last
name with Mr. or Miss, which is unusual in the
mountains, is always most impressive), &lsquo;you are
guilty of breaking a rule of the school. You must
remain and write twenty times each the sentence I
shall put upon the board.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then an old song came suddenly into my mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
and I wrote without quiver of lash or hint of smile
the silly lines:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;&lsquo;Frog went courting, he did ride,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Sword and pistol by his side.&rsquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That!&rsquo; said the fellow, looking startled, while
the girl hung her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, that,&rsquo; I replied in perfect seriousness. And
the two wrote the lines under my most calm, most
dignified eye till they were thoroughly disgusted
with themselves and one another. When at last
they went out, the girl tossed her head and ignored
both her crestfallen and her jealous lover. With
books under her arm she went alone straightway to
the boarding hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story of the discomfited lovers is spreading
in the school, and the quotation of &lsquo;Frog went courting,
he did ride,&rsquo; hilariously given is quenching the
ardour of many an amorous swain. Possibly a little
wholesome humour may after all be more helpful
than stern enforcement of rules, and you know if
there is one thing more than another we mountain
folks lack, it is a sense of humour! So, even on
general principles, it will do no harm to cultivate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, with all this cruel separation of tender
hearts perhaps I am in a fair way to become a cynical
old bachelor instead of a sentimentalist.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>He was determined to write cheerfully, for he
knew that she constantly grieved over the alienation
between Mr. Polk and himself, so his letters usually
held bright accounts of his work, though sometimes
he let her have a glimpse of the struggle which went
on in his heart.</p>
<p>He wrote once after a contest with himself over
natural desire for more congenial surroundings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little mother, when things seem too sordid and
commonplace and barren for endurance, as I confess
they have a way of doing at times, I do crave a look
into your dear face. But as I am too far away to see
you clearly, I remember how you came down here
and worked with dauntless courage and good cheer,
and I take heart again. Then several things recently
have contributed to make me ashamed of faint-heartedness,
and I really think I am going to develop
some stronger fibre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pathos of the mountain desire for &lsquo;larnin&rdquo;
has come to me overwhelmingly lately. A woman
came on foot forty miles over the mountains last
week bringing her daughter and seven others of
neighbours and friends to the school only to find
there was no room for them. But so great was the
mother&rsquo;s distress and so appealing her sacrifice and
hardship in making the trip that one of our lady
teachers took the daughter into her own room rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
than see the mother disappointed. A few days later
two boys came in having driven a pair of lean goats
over thirty miles hitched to a rude cart, which held
all the earthly possessions they could muster, the old
father and mother walking behind,&ndash;&ndash;all hoping to
buy entrance to the school for the boys. They, too,
were disappointed, for we are full to overflowing this
year. Then to cap the argument for stout-heartedness
on my part, I went for a stroll yesterday afternoon
and came across a boy who is making one of
the bravest fights for an education that I ever saw.
I found him putting his shoulder to great boulders
on the mountainside, rolling them down and then
setting himself to break them in pieces for use in
paving our little town,&ndash;&ndash;for you must know that
under the influence of the school it is beginning to
strive for general improvement. The boy, whose
father is a worthless fellow, works at rock-breaking
till he earns enough to go to school a while; then,
when the money is gone, he returns to work again
with a pathetic patience which has stirred me deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, mother mine, when I long for a sight of your
face,&ndash;&ndash;and an old-time hand-clasp from Mr. Polk, as
I assure you I too often do, or when I crave the
feast of books and the quiet student atmosphere of a
city library, I am simply going to think on these
things in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>The second summer in the mountains came on
and was a repetition of the first. The school was
getting more pupils than could be accommodated, it
was true, but Steve felt that contact with the thought
of education would help to further the general cause.
Then, journeying about through the wilderness was
also a means of gathering fresh material for his
nature and hunting stories for boys.</p>
<p>There was a distinct drawing towards the Follets
in his subconscious mind, the real objective of
which he would scarcely admit to himself. He put
from him suggestive pictures of curls and pinafores
which memory and flitting dreams still flashed before
him at times. He meant to go there some day
for he wanted to express his gratitude for all the
kindness of the past, but the time had not yet come.
He must not for the present be diverted in the least
from the purpose which was occupying him. He
must repay Mr. Polk,&ndash;&ndash;that was the thought which
dominated him, and to that end he was frugally
gathering all the money he could. As he had
carried the fox skin through the wilderness when a
boy, so now he carried the thought of that debt in
his mind, and no robber in the form of pleasant indulgence
should prevent him from meeting his
obligation.</p>
<p>The second session passed, and he had learned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
how to handle his difficulties with better success,
while his method of teaching was more definitely
marked out and he found more leisure for the use of
his pen. Fresh, bright stories with the breath of
the mountains in them began to find ready sale, and
occasionally as his pen dipped a bit into romance it
brought more than ordinary returns. Upon the tide
of this success came a strong temptation: Why not
go to a distinctly literary atmosphere and make a
business of literature? He felt an inward assurance
of making good and a longing for the work which
was almost overpowering. Money for the debt
must continue to accumulate very slowly when so
much time must be given to the daily business of
teaching, for which he was very poorly paid, and he
could not know freedom until that debt was paid.
In literary work, too, he could combine the cause of
mountain need with his daily task with equal effectiveness
in both directions, for could he not portray
with great pathos the mental, spiritual and material
poverty of his people? And he stifled for the moment
something within him which cried, &ldquo;Others
might do that, but never one of our own!&rdquo; Beside
all this it was probable, as Mr. Polk had said, that
money was more sorely needed for schools than personal
service and he believed by giving himself to
literary work he could earn it. He had never been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
perfectly sure that giving his life to teaching and
personal work among his people was the best method
of helping them, so he need not feel chagrined by
any inconsistency.</p>
<p>So great was the temptation which came to him
at this crisis that he determined when the session
closed to go for a visit to Mirandy&rsquo;s family and from
there to the Follets, with the thought that he would
not like to leave the mountains without seeing them,
and it would doubtless be best to go east for his
literary career. In this satisfactory justification of
the latter visit he allowed himself the freedom of
pleasant reminiscence about the spot where life first
began to really unfold for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Nancy,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;why she must
be nineteen now, clothed in long frocks and maidenly
dignity, I suspect,&ndash;&ndash;but I certainly hope she still
wears the little white pinafores.&rdquo; And his eyes grew
misty with a tenderness which he would have classified
as brotherly, had it occurred to him to question
himself. Then he smiled suddenly and said, &ldquo;Yes,
I must go and see about those pinafores before I
leave the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the visit to Hollow Hut first, and in the
ease of a saddle seat he reached the old familiar wood
by a much more direct trail than he had followed
when a boy. He halted his pony at last by the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
boulder where Tige lay buried. The tragedy of his
grief on that long-ago morning when he had touched
the stiffened body of his old friend came back to
him with such vividness that, in spite of &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s
long caressing hand,&rdquo; he could not &ldquo;smile beholding
it.&rdquo; He hitched his horse close by with a sense of
the old dog&rsquo;s nearness and protection, for he meant
to camp on that spot during his stay as he used to
do when a boy. Then he went on foot down the
mountainside to his old home in the hollow, little
dreaming, as he passed along its rocky fastness, that
a &ldquo;still&rdquo; was hidden there.</p>
<p>It was just dusk of an early June day, and cool
shadows dropped their soft curtains about the old
log house as he walked towards the door unannounced.
He stopped a moment at the grave of his
father and mother, and then followed noiselessly the
little worn path to the cabin. As he drew near, he
saw the fitful light of blazing pine-knots on the
hearth and caught the sound of boisterous laughter.
Reaching the door he stood a moment in the shadow
of the outer darkness, before stepping into the light.
Then,&ndash;&ndash;what he saw transfixed him! White to the
lips he watched a moment.</p>
<p>A group of men, Mirandy&rsquo;s husband among them,
surrounded a little fellow about six years old, who,
having been made reeling drunk, was trying to walk
a crack in the floor. The little victim swayed and
tottered and struggled under the hilarious urging of
his spectators.</p>

&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s Champ fer his pappy&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s first mad impulse was to snatch up the
wronged child, and, if necessary, face the half-drunken
men in battle. But this would be worse
than useless his second sober thought told him, for
there stood Mirandy looking carelessly on from the
kitchen door behind. The child was doubtless hers,
and the father was taking part in the revolting deed!
What could he do? He knew they would brook no
interference.</p>
<p>With hard-won self-control he stepped upon the
threshold, courteously lifted his hat and bade them
&ldquo;Good-evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the men turned and pistols clicked, for
they thought him a revenue officer; but Mirandy,
looking into his still boyish face which had caught
the light, while his unfamiliar figure was in shadow,
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot! Hit&rsquo;s Steve, my little buddie
Steve!&rdquo; And she stepped across the room to him
in a way which showed she was capable of being
stirred into action sometimes.</p>
<p>The men looked uncertain, but Mirandy&rsquo;s husband,
peering into Steve&rsquo;s face a moment, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, hit&rsquo;s Steve Langly, though I&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
nuver knowed ye in the world,&rdquo; and the other men
dropped back.</p>
<p>The child in the centre of the room looked about
with dull eyes, then dropped to the floor in a pitiful
little drunken heap.</p>
<p>With his heart wrung to the point of agony, Steve
stepped forward and stooping down lifted it tenderly
to his breast. In the old home that little boy represented
himself, as he used to be. When he could
speak he said in a voice which trembled upon the
silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my little nephew, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mirandy cried out sharply to her husband,
without answering the question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shan&rsquo;t nuver do that no more,&rdquo; and the men
slunk out one by one, ashamed, rebuked, sobered,
though they could not have told why.</p>
<p>Steve turned as they left and sat down, still holding
the child to his breast. Then gently releasing
his hold with one hand he tenderly pushed back the
damp hair from the little swollen face, while Mirandy
stood by, the tears dropping down her cheeks,&ndash;&ndash;a
thing most unusual for a mountain woman. And
she said again passionately, &ldquo;Champ shan&rsquo;t nuver
make him drunk agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; asked Steve at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit&rsquo;s Champ fer his pappy. The bigges&rsquo; one&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
outdoors some&rsquo;eres,&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s named Steve,&rdquo; she
said in mollifying tone. &ldquo;He was borned the nex&rsquo;
winter atter you was here, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d been sech a
likely lookin&rsquo; boy I thought I&rsquo;d name him fer ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was good ev you, Randy,&rdquo; said Steve dropping
tenderly into the old form of speech. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
glad ter see my namesake. Air the two all ye hev?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thar&rsquo;s the baby on the bed; she&rsquo;s a little
gal,&rdquo; Mirandy replied dully. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s two on
&rsquo;em that died, when they was babies. We women
allus gits chillun enough,&rdquo; she said, in a whining
voice peculiar to the older women of the mountains
which she had already acquired.</p>
<p>Steve remained a month and it was the most trying
time of his life. When he learned of the &ldquo;still,&rdquo;
which he did very promptly, despair for Mirandy,
her husband and the children filled his heart. Champ
Brady was always under the influence of his &ldquo;moonshine,&rdquo;
and Steve knew it was perfectly useless to
try to dissuade him from making or using it. Mirandy
had his own distaste for it, but she had been accustomed
to the thought of its free use all her life, and
how could he make her listless mind comprehend its
danger for her children? Not trusting her emotion
and passionate protest the day he came, he talked
with her earnestly many times and made her promise
to do all she could to keep the children from it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>He took the two little boys, Steve and Champ, with
their dog, every day up to the old haunt by Tige&rsquo;s
rock, where he camped every night. He had brought
picture books with him, illustrated alphabets and one-syllable
stories with the thought of possible need for
them. And the brown eyes of the two little fellows,
so like his own in the old days, as he well knew, in
their blankness and wonder, gave eager response to
new things. He called the spot &ldquo;our school,&rdquo; and the
two little pupils soon learned their letters, while in a
month&rsquo;s time little Steve was reading simple stories
telling that &ldquo;The dog is on the mat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The cat
is on the rug&rdquo; with great exhilaration, and spelling
out laboriously more complex things.</p>
<p>But Champ Brady was restless under the visit.
He told Mirandy frequently that he had no use for a
fellow who hadn&rsquo;t enough stuff in him to drink good
liquor when it was put before him; and Steve, knowing
well his state of mind without hearing any expression
of it, went sadly away from the cabin at
Hollow Hut for the third time.</p>
<p>After a last earnest talk with Mirandy, he took the
little boys to the old spot where they had kept school
and he had camped for the month and put into the
hands of Steve the second a German silver watch
which he had also brought with the thought of a boy
in the old home again as a possibility.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This little shining ticker will tell you each day
that you are going to make big, strong men who
know things one of these days. You will listen to
it always, will you not?&rdquo; he said, and each in turn,
as he was held up in the tender arms, promised earnestly
with queer aching in their little throats. Then
Steve set them down and rode away, looking back
again and again with a waving hand at the two
sober little figures as long as they were in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God of the wilderness,&rdquo; he cried, when at
last he saw them no more, &ldquo;Thou didst come and
comfort me when I wandered here alone; oh, now
give me assurance that Thou wilt watch over these
two of my own blood and bring them into the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prayer went up in despair akin to that of his
boyhood&rsquo;s desolation and again, after a time, a sense
of comfort and peace flooded his soul, while, in its
full tide, a fresh resolve was fixed upon him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give my life to the work. Not money
alone, please God, if I should make it, but my daily
breath and life and vigour shall go for the uplift of
my people of the mountains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he smiled to think that literature should ever
have appealed to him, for a sense of linking himself
to the Almighty God to whom he had prayed had
come to him in the holy stillness of the wilderness,
making anything else seem trivial beyond compare.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>He did not go to the Follets as he had intended,
but made his way slowly back to the school, stopping
at cabins here and there as in previous summers,
chatting with the people, getting into their life and
giving them visions as no alien could have done.</p>
<p>On this trip he passed a great coal mine and here
he spent a couple of weeks watching the work with
great interest. He carefully examined the various
strata of the excavation and studied the practical
working of the mine with keen intent, his college
course having given him ample preparation for its
intelligent comprehension.</p>
<p>Suddenly a bright thought struck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;why not locate
a mine here in the mountains, as Mr. Polk used to
talk of my doing, buy the land for a few hundred dollars,
as I am sure I can in some localities, and then
make it over to Mr. Polk? He will know how to
handle it, and if it is valuable will certainly make it
pay. With another year&rsquo;s work I can have the
money, and by that means I can cancel that debt
with one fell stroke, perhaps,&rdquo; he went on jubilantly,&ndash;&ndash;and
if it proved to do so many times over, he
would only be the more rejoiced, he thought.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>LOVE&rsquo;S AWAKENING</h3>
</div>
<p>Full of this happy inspiration Steve went
back to his work, determined to gather during
the year a sum sufficient to make his
purchase, so as to be ready for the next vacation
when he would be free to go prospecting. Under
the stimulus of this good hope he worked with great
absorption, only allowing himself the recreation of a
weekly letter to Mrs. Polk, which he never failed to
send, continuing to put into it all the interesting and
amusing things which came into his work,&ndash;&ndash;and they
did come in spite of the seriousness of his life.</p>
<p>Oftentimes in brooding thought he went back to
the little Steve who was duplicating his own early
life in the old home. He had considered mountain
educational work hitherto in the large; he began
now to think of it from the nucleus of the home.
How he would like to see the old spot of his boyhood
redeemed by an ideal home life! And the
thought touched many latent springs of his manly
nature, calling forth dim, sweet visions of domestic
love and beauty.</p>
<p>But he hushed nature&rsquo;s appeal peremptorily, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
thrust back the visions with the firm decision that he
had no leisure for dreams, and continued his many-sided
work through another winter with accustomed
constancy. It was in the early spring of that year
when an unexpected telegram came to him from
Mrs. Polk. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet Nita and myself at L&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; to-morrow,
7 <span class='smcaplc'>A. M.</span> train&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How the brief message thrilled him! He had
plodded so long alone. He sprang up from his
place at the breakfast table where the message had
been handed him, his eyes shining and his step
buoyant. Securing leave of absence from school
duties for a couple of days, he went at once to hire
a team which would take him forty miles over the
mountains to the railroad station.</p>
<p>Forty miles! With a good team and a buoyant
spirit they seemed little more than so many city
blocks. To look into the face and talk once more
with the &ldquo;little mother&rdquo; would renew his enthusiasm
for his work. She must have known that he was
growing dull and spiritless with the lingering winter
days,&ndash;&ndash;she had such a wonderful way of divining
things. His eyes grew misty with tender recollection
of her.</p>
<p>And Nita,&ndash;&ndash;beautiful Nita Trowbridge,&ndash;&ndash;when she
should step out in the early morning light, it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
be like flashing his glorious mountain sunrise upon
some artist&rsquo;s masterpiece! And he was hungry for
the beauty and grace and charm of the city which
she embodied. Yes, it was true, there was no denying
it! And fast and faster sped the retreating miles
under his joyful expectations till the journey was
ended, a night&rsquo;s refreshing sleep had passed and he
stood at last at the little station, restlessly pacing up
and down the platform, with eye and ear strained to
detect the first hint of the incoming train.</p>
<p>Next he was rushing into the rear sleeper!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; were the greetings as he took Mrs. Polk
in his arms while the eyes of both brimmed with
tears. Then turning quickly to Nita, he greeted her
with less demonstration but with equal warmth.</p>
<p>Catching up their hand-bags he hurried them out,
for through trains show scant respect for mountain
stations, and leading the way to his waiting vehicle
he helped Mrs. Polk in with easy confidence, then
turned to Nita. What was it about her that made
him instantly conscious that the spring wagonette
was very plain, the newness long gone and that the
horses, with abundant manes and tails, lacked trimness
and style? He started to apologize for his
turnout, then quickly set his lips. If he must begin
apologizing here, where would it end?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is just a mild forerunner of the heights before
you,&rdquo; he said laughingly, as he carefully helped
her mount the high step before which she had stood
uncertainly.</p>
<p>But the trip proved equally delightful for them all.
The mountain air was bracing, the morning panorama
spread out before them, gloriously beautiful as it always
was, brought constant delighted exclamation
from both Mrs. Polk and Nita while Steve found
fresh enjoyment in their pleasure.</p>
<p>The little cabins which came into view on the way,
standing bare and barren by the roadside, or looking
out from forest recesses where there was hardly a
road to follow, or clinging to some lofty &ldquo;bench&rdquo;
upon the mountainside, all were fronted by poorly
clad children gazing in solemn, open-mouthed interest
while the strangers passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little things,&rdquo; said Mrs. Polk, &ldquo;they stand
in mute appeal to us to open a path for them out
into our world,&ndash;&ndash;to take them into the fold of our
larger brotherhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve looked back into her bright, earnest face
with kindling eyes, while Nita turned from one to
the other with the old childish wonder again in her
face. These mountain folk were a new species to
her, interesting and amusing perhaps, but from whom
she instinctively shrank. Not that she was in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
least disdainful, she was of too sweet a nature for
that, but she had no conception of a divine bond of
human kinship which could ever include her and
them.</p>
<p>They spent the night at a mountain village, breaking
the long drive for the ladies, and the next day
reached the school where Steve daily gave his best,
and which was so dear to Mrs. Polk. During the
two days following, as during the trip, Steve made
them as comfortable as possible, still making no
apologies for anything, and indeed no apology was
necessary, for Mrs. Polk had known what to expect,
and the royal hospitality which glorified it, while
Nita accepted the one with simple good taste and
the other with real, if not genial, appreciation. The
visit was full of interest for Mrs. Polk as she noted
the growth of the work, and Nita went about through
school buildings and grounds, her beauty and tasteful
attire making her a most observed visitor. Nor
did she fail to show interest in the work, thoroughly
courteous and kindly, and yet which somehow seemed
detached.</p>
<p>As Steve followed her with admiring eyes and sincere
regard, he could not help seeing most clearly
that she could never fit into the mountain landscape.
He thought whimsically of Mr. Polk&rsquo;s dreams for her
and himself and knew that though he could have remained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
in her world and found happiness, she could
never have come into his. His early intuition had
not been at fault; she would never touch the height,
breadth and depth of universal womanhood with its
vision and its sympathy.</p>
<p>Just before leaving, the two visitors spent a recitation
period in Steve&rsquo;s class room, and so eager was
he to reveal the best in his pupils that he did not
dream he was also putting forth the teacher&rsquo;s
best.</p>
<p>When the pupils had filed out and the three stood
alone, Mrs. Polk made a gay little bow, and said with
glistening eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Sir Knight of the Mountains, you have
certainly won your spurs,&ndash;&ndash;though they be of civilian
make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled in return, brought back to a consciousness
of himself, but turning from it instantly again,
he inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think of my brother knights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are equally fine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Polk warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are indeed,&rdquo; joined in Nita, &ldquo;but how you
have penetrated the hopeless exteriors of these people,
as we saw them on our way here, found the
germs of promise and developed them, will always
remain an unfathomable mystery for me,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;I confess I understand your skill less than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
I do that of the sculptor who makes the marble
express beauty, thought and feeling,&ndash;&ndash;and his work
would be infinitely more to my taste. I think nothing
more distasteful than contact with people can be,&ndash;&ndash;and
when it must be daily&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She shrugged
her shoulders in conclusion expressively.</p>
<p>Steve smiled back at her for he knew she did not
think of him as one of these people with whom she
could not bear the thought of daily contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now confess, don&rsquo;t you get dreadfully tired of it
all?&rdquo; she persisted, looking with real appeal into his
face as though she would draw him away from it if
she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unspeakably, sometimes,&rdquo; he smiled back again,
then looking beyond her over the mountains he
added simply, &ldquo;but I belong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And uncomprehending as she would ever be, she
turned at last lightly away and walking to the outer
door stepped out upon the campus, leaving her sister
and Steve for a little talk alone, which she was sure
they would like.</p>
<p>When she was gone, Mrs. Polk laid a hand upon
Steve&rsquo;s arm and said softly: &ldquo;Some day, Steve, everything
will come right,&rdquo; looking expressively into his
eyes, and he knew she meant between himself and
Mr. Polk, a subject that had not been mentioned since
she came. &ldquo;I catch beautiful prophecies sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of all this human desert blossoming as a rose,&rdquo; she
went on with her old gay enthusiasm, &ldquo;and I am
fully persuaded now, as I never have quite been since
you left us, that you have chosen your work wisely.
I had to come at last and see for myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you going to live your life alone, Steve,
dear,&rdquo; she asked after a moment wistfully, &ldquo;with no
sweet home ties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, little mother,&rdquo; he said gravely.
His mind went instantly to the old cabin home and
little Steve, but he couldn&rsquo;t tell even her of the family
life there now,&ndash;&ndash;nor yet of the mystic vision which
had intruded upon his brooding thought.</p>
<p>His sudden smile flashed over the seriousness of
his face as he replied at last, &ldquo;I have been too busy
and too poor to think about it so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not smile in return, but catching both his
hands in hers she looked up at him with motherly
insistence, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you never loved any dear girl? Is there
no sweet face that sometimes steals into the little
home which nestles always in every true man&rsquo;s innermost
heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her strong mother-love had surely lent her a
mystic&rsquo;s insight and compelling power!</p>
<p>Instantly into the dim outline of the vision of his
brooding thought which he had hitherto constantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
thrust aside, came with a distinctness that startled
him, a childish face framed in yellow curls above a
little white pinafore!</p>
<p>He caught his breath with the vividness of it, then
pulled himself together and looking down into the
dear eyes of the woman who had been more than
second mother to him, and who thereby had won
the right to question him, he said with a curiously
puzzled look:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I do not know,&ndash;&ndash;perhaps so,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;then, as
she still looked intently at him, &ldquo;you have startled
me. I have become such a stupid grind, I guess I
need waking up. I will commune with myself, as I
have never done before, and let you know what I
discover,&rdquo; he ended more lightly.</p>
<p>She knew that a revelation had come to him in
that moment and was content without further questioning.
With a last gentle, loving pressure for his
hands she released them and they walked out together
to join Nita.</p>
<p>Their team was soon ready and after another long,
pleasant drive Steve was watching the departing
train from the little station platform. He felt keen
regret as it bore his friends out of sight, but he
turned to his team for the homeward drive with a
strange exhilaration in his heart. He had hardly
been able to wait for that communion with himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
and when the opportunity came there was no uncertainty
in its tenor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I love Nancy Follet! I have loved her
ever since I first set eyes upon her sweet little face,&ndash;&ndash;and
it has come before me always in any stress of
mind or heart as though to tell me she was always
to have part in my life. And yet I have been so
dull I did not understand. She pre&euml;mpted my heart
from the first and that is why I did not love beautiful
Nita Trowbridge,&ndash;&ndash;why I have never been able
to look at any girl with a spark of interest since.&rdquo;
How he loved to linger over the revelation which
had come to him! It was like having emerged from
a desert into a land flowing with milk and honey.
Little Nancy! She had been so gentle, so confiding,
so eager to help him with things,&ndash;&ndash;she would be his
dear helper in the work of his life,&ndash;&ndash;and the work
would thereby be glorified beyond measure! Under
the spell of his tender musing the forty miles again
sped by unheeded and he was back once more at the
schoolroom door.</p>
<p>It was well that his tasks for the year were well-nigh
over, for he at once became consumed with the
desire to see Nancy in the maturity of her girlhood.
He promptly decided that he would go as soon as
school closed and win her promise before he went on
that prospecting tour. In the meantime his mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
continued to hover over the hours they had spent
together as boy and girl. He went to mill once
more walking beside a little fairy figure on old
Dobbin&rsquo;s back,&ndash;&ndash;he caught the fragrance of shy
flowers which nestled in cool woodland depths, and
memory let softly down the bars into a holy of holies
as the little girl said again in her sweet innocence,
&ldquo;Steve, let&rsquo;s build us a house in this wood and live
here always.&rdquo; He mounted the rugged steeps of
Greely&rsquo;s Ridge, her strong protector, while she
reached down once more a timid little hand to hold
his tightly,&ndash;&ndash;and suddenly he was startled with remembrance
of the character of that ridge. It must
have held minerals! Coal, yes, coal,&ndash;&ndash;he was sure
of it! There was the piece of land he had been
wanting to find!</p>
<p>And so with buoyant, twofold hope he started as
soon as school was out towards the Follet home,
having deposited in the bank a sum which he felt
would be sufficient to purchase the Greely Ridge,
should he find it as valuable as he suspected and no
one had preceded him in its discovery.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>OLD TIES RENEWED</h3>
</div>
<p>It was mid-afternoon of a late June day when
Steve stopped at Mr. Follet&rsquo;s store. He wondered
if his old friend would be there. Yes,
the door was open, and for a moment Steve stood on
the platform in front, his tall figure erect, his head
bared as he looked reverently towards the little
home which had opened the world of books to him.
Then Mr. Follet&rsquo;s high voice rang out from the dark
depths where dry-goods and groceries rioted in hopeless
confusion as of old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, stranger, what&rsquo;s the time o&rsquo; day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve stepping forward put out an eager hand, and
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Follet, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man only stared, coming forward into the
light of the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw you before,&rdquo; he declared at last; &ldquo;or
if I did, can&rsquo;t tell where under the cano<i>pee</i> &rsquo;twas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve laughed with keen enjoyment at hearing
the familiar old expression, and said eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember Steve, little Steve Langly
who worked for you one summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Follet; &ldquo;of course I do;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
nobody at my house has forgotten him, not by a jugful,&ndash;&ndash;but
this ain&rsquo;t Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> Steve though, Mr. Follet,&ndash;&ndash;the same
Steve, with just as grateful a heart for you and Mrs.
Follet as I had the day I left you about a dozen
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this does beat me,&rdquo; said Mr. Follet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
lock right up and go over to the house. My wife
and Nancy will be powerful glad to see you if they
can ever think who under the cano<i>pee</i> you are.&rdquo;
And he stepped briskly about locking up, and then
the two walked over to the house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Follet was seated on the piazza with some
light sewing when they came up, and to Mr. Follet&rsquo;s
excited introduction of Mr. Langly she made polite
but unrecognizing acknowledgment, and her husband
was too impatient to delay his revelation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, ma, you don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t know
Steve,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Follet bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes! little, old, scrawny, mountain Steve,&rdquo;
exclaimed Mr. Follet, &ldquo;who did everything that was
done here one summer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Follet slowly grasped the astonishing
thought that little ignorant Steve and the fine-looking
young man before her were one and the same, and
gave him gentle, motherly greeting.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nancy?&rdquo; went on Mr. Follet, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone with Gyp for a gallop,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Follet, &ldquo;but she ought to be back any minute now.&rdquo;
And by the time they had exchanged brief accounts
of the years that had passed since they last met,
Nancy was seen swaying gracefully down the road
upon her pony&rsquo;s rounded back. She waved gaily as
she passed the porch not noticing the stranger who
was somewhat screened by hanging vines, and then
she turned into the lane which led to the stable.</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s eyes glistened at the vision of the girl
which time had so charmingly matured, and starting
up he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me meet her at the stable where I used to help
her on and off old Dobbin&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; and with a bound
he was off the porch and striding towards the lane.</p>
<p>Nancy had slowed her pace along the shady driveway,
and Steve, going noiselessly through the grass,
was at her side when she was ready to dismount.</p>
<p>Smilingly he held out his hand for her to step
upon, his glowing eyes lifted to hers. Startled she
drew back, her eyes held and fascinated, however, by
his intent gaze.</p>
<p>For a long instant they gazed, and then she
breathed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>Had the meeting occurred otherwise, she probably
would never have taken the tall, broad-shouldered,
handsome young fellow for the Steve of her childish
memory, but she only saw and recognized those
brown eyes lifted to hers as they used to be in the
old days when he took her from Dobbin&rsquo;s back, with
the same tender light in them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Nancy, it&rsquo;s Steve!&rdquo; he exclaimed joyfully.
&ldquo;And you knew me after all these years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile that held something sweet and sensitive
flashed assent, and then in reaction from the stir of
undefined feeling, which she was not ready to acknowledge,
her eyes danced with sudden humour.
Keeping her saddle she glanced behind her to the
pony&rsquo;s back, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are our bags of meal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve laughed in responsive gaiety, and in spite of
himself let his eyes rest upon her in kindling admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see good grist which the mill of time has
ground for you,&rdquo; he said, and put out his palm again
for her to step upon.</p>
<p>But she, flushing with girlish surprise at his ready
gallantry, which showed how completely the little
mountain boy had been lost in the cultured man,
drew back once more and with equal quick wit said,
laughing:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You will certainly find it has, and in good, substantial
material if you try to take my weight in your
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same mill has ground out for me an adequate
amount of muscle,&rdquo; he declared, adding with a hint
of pleading in his voice, &ldquo;You must let me renew
old times,&rdquo; and without further protest she lightly
touched his hand with her foot as she sprang from
the pony&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weight doesn&rsquo;t count with so light a touch as
that,&rdquo; laughed Steve, and started to lead the pony
into the stable, when a coloured boy stepped up to
care for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see we keep a groom these days,&rdquo; said
Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what style the mountains are taking on,&rdquo;
returned Steve, as Nancy gathered up the long skirt
of her riding habit, and the two walked together
through the grass to the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what an astonishing height you have grown,&rdquo;
said she with naive charm, looking up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done equally well,&rdquo; he returned, measuring
with his eye her slender length; then he added
with his sudden smile which held the whimsical
quality of old friendship, &ldquo;Please tell me,&ndash;&ndash;where are
the curls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are tucked snugly away out of sight,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
said she demurely, with a pretty gesture which straying
tendrils had made habitual, and the warm colour
rising again to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be a law against carrying curls
concealed,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>By this time they were at the porch, and as they
resumed the family exchange of items of interest
from each side, Steve and Nancy sitting on the steps
as in the old days, he saw the fair dream-structure of
the past few weeks in the beginning of complete
realization.</p>
<p>In the evening as Mr. and Mrs. Follet, Steve and
Nancy sat again on the porch enjoying the night
air after a warm day, they talked interestedly of old
times and the changes which had taken place. Steve
found that Crosscut, the little flag station over which
Mr. Follet presided, had expanded into a small straggling
town with a meeting-house, school of uncertain
sessions and a thriving saloon.</p>
<p>As they chatted pleasantly a young man turned
into the gate and came up the path with a debonair
swing that proclaimed him much at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy everybody,&rdquo; he said jauntily, and Nancy
rose with pleasant greeting for him. Then turning
to Steve she introduced Mr. Colton to Mr. Langly.</p>
<p>Steve met the newcomer with quiet courtesy, while
Mr. Colton responded with cordiality of the &ldquo;hail-fellow-well-met&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
type, and immediately seated himself
beside Nancy with an air of proprietorship.</p>
<p>Very soon Mr. Follet in the course of conversation
turned and addressed Steve by his first name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; exclaimed the visitor. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Miss
Nancy introduce you to me as Mr. Langly? Are
you Steve Langly who visited Louisville with a Mr.
Polk some ten or twelve years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Steve with much surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; returned Mr. Colton with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Well, I am Raymond Colton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed Steve heartily. &ldquo;Well, this
is pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; returned Raymond. &ldquo;I tell
you, old fellow, we never forgot that lickin&rsquo; you gave
us at our school&ndash;&ndash;served us right and did us good.&rdquo;
He launched into a hilarious account of that experience
which everybody enjoyed, and there was a little
pleasant, general conversation. Then Raymond suddenly
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Nancy, where&rsquo;s your banjo?&rdquo; and went at
once for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Steve, she can play on the old banjo
and sing as no one else ever did,&rdquo; he said as he returned
and laid it in her lap.</p>
<p>Nancy turned to Steve with a quick flush which
showed even in the moonlight and protested: &ldquo;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
really don&rsquo;t know a thing about it, only what father
taught me when I was a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mr. Follet said excitedly, &ldquo;You see, Steve,
she was so lonesome after you left I had to get the
old thing down to cheer her up. I hadn&rsquo;t played
any on it since I was a young fellow courtin&rsquo; her
mother. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d ever got her without
that banjo,&rdquo; he added and laughed with great good
humour. &ldquo;Nancy don&rsquo;t think much of it,&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;She thinks it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; beside the piano, but
Raymond, here, is like me, he thinks it beats the
piano all hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing &lsquo;Robin Adair,&rsquo;&rdquo; put in Raymond, and
Nancy began striking soft minor chords for a little
prelude. Then a rich, contralto voice, low and
clear, told the tender old story of Robin Adair and
his love, which the banjo echoed with little improvised
hints of the air. Raymond and Mr. Follet
called for one song after another of the old favourites,
Raymond often joining in with a fine tenor,
which harmonized perfectly with Nancy&rsquo;s contralto.
At last she sang of her own accord &ldquo;The
Rosary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an exquisite pathos in the beautiful,
heart-breaking notes that stirred Steve deeply. What
depth of feeling, as well as maidenly reserve and
charm, his little Nancy had developed! The curls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
and pinafores were gone, it was true, but as he
watched her sweet, expressive face in the moonlight
and felt the fullness of her sympathy and understanding
in the singing, he said to himself, &ldquo;I am
willing to lose them for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Nancy, please don&rsquo;t ever sing that any
more; it gives me the shivers,&rdquo; said Raymond and
was seconded by Mr. Follet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bedtime for old folks, anyhow,&rdquo; the latter
went on, and added, &ldquo;I guess Steve&rsquo;s tired enough
to go, too,&rdquo; and though Steve was not ready to admit
this, Raymond gave him gay good-night and
he followed his host to the little attic room where he
had slept as a boy, and which Mrs. Follet had made
ready for him, because he had insisted that it was
just the place for him. The house was small and he
knew somebody must vacate comfortable quarters if
he slept elsewhere.</p>
<p>But once in the old bed Steve did not find fair
memories crowding about as he had anticipated.
Even the echoing sweet songs lost their melody. Indeed
he could think of nothing but the fact that
Nancy and Raymond Colton sat together on the
front porch, left there by her parents as though he
had special rights. A midnight thunder-storm
caught up his perturbed thought with noisy energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not!&rdquo; he exclaimed sadly for the hundredth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
time to his rebellious heart. &ldquo;You certainly
have no claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that lately aroused, throbbing fountain of
love&rsquo;s pulsations replied with vehemence: &ldquo;I have!
I have loved her every moment since I first looked
upon her as a little girl, and I love her in her sweet
maturity with all my soul. She is mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the wordy war went on between his good sense
and his yearning heart, banishing every dear,
cherished memory and postponing sleep till the
wee morning hours.</p>
<p>Next day after the breakfast dishes were done,
Mrs. Follet proposed that Nancy take Steve for a
ride with Gyp and the family horse over to the
Greely woods, their old favourite haunt, and this
exactly suited Steve, for, in spite of the night&rsquo;s disturbance,
nothing could please him more than an
opportunity for companionship with Nancy alone,
and he was still impatient to see if his memory of
that rugged ridge of woodland was correct.</p>
<p>He went out at once to saddle the horses. It was
a crisp, cool, clear morning after the storm, and
Nancy soon appeared in a trim riding habit and cap
with deep visor to shade the eyes. The severe lines
and dark blue of her costume made charming contrast
to her softly rounded face, with its delicate
colouring and the stray yellow tendrils of hair which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
were always slipping out from the fluffy braids which
bound her head. She surely was fair to look upon,
and when Steve had assisted her to mount in the old
way,&ndash;&ndash;holding out his hand and she stepping upon
it in laughing ease,&ndash;&ndash;she sat her pony with the
graceful poise of the true Kentucky girl, making a
picture which less partial observers than Steve could
not have failed to find full of charm. They cantered
off briskly down the road.</p>
<p>When they reached the wood Steve grew keenly
reminiscent, as had become his habit the last few
weeks. Forgetting Raymond completely, the past
came back to him vividly; he seemed to feel again
Nancy&rsquo;s confiding trust in him,&ndash;&ndash;and he yearned to
know how clearly she remembered. He looked
often upon her as she rode beside him, the two
horses touching noses in the narrow path, but the
delicate face revealed nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;what
a veritable slave you made of me in this old
wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed brightly and replied, &ldquo;Why no, I
haven&rsquo;t any such recollection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you knew even then just how to do it,&rdquo; he
returned with a bit of insinuation. &ldquo;You would
look up at the tallest, hardest tree to climb and see
some high-hanging blossom which you coveted, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
I immediately scaled the tree&rsquo;s height to lay the
blossom at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again and her cheeks this time flushed
a rosy hue, unaccountably disconcerting to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that, after all, was as it should have been,&rdquo;
he went on after a moment, smiling. &ldquo;We men
need your bidding to send us to the heights, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not agree with you,&rdquo; she said, recovering
her poise instantly; and summoning a girlish perversity,
she led him straightway from sentiment to
the substantial. &ldquo;Each one must mount up in his
own strength, like these splendid old trees, without
prop or help, only the light from above to draw it
upward,&rdquo; and a very demure look crossed her ever-changing
face as she finished the little speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Steve smiling and remembering
Mrs. Polk&rsquo;s lesson from the giant beech so
long ago. &ldquo;And yet, after all, many things help
the tree in its growth besides the light from above,&ndash;&ndash;the
sun. There are the winds and the rain, and&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
paused a moment,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;its mates. Don&rsquo;t you know
a tree rarely stands alone unless man has cut down
its companions. They like comradeship. I believe
they are dependent upon it in ways we do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How stupid of me to forget I was talking with
a professor,&rdquo; said Nancy archly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And worse still for me to forget that I was trying
to enlighten the lady who initiated me into the
world of books,&rdquo; replied he promptly, yielding to
her mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely that graceful, clinging vine is,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, ignoring his retort and pointing up
to a vine covered tree, while Steve thrust back into
the secret place of his heart all the cherished memories
which the old wood held for him, realizing
decidedly that Nancy was no longer a shy, timid
little girl ready to place her hand in his, but a young
woman who would need to be wooed before she was
won,&ndash;&ndash;even though there were no Raymond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What had he expected anyway?&rdquo; he reiterated
sternly. &ldquo;That she would be waiting his coming,
all ready for the plucking?&rdquo; He straightened himself
in the saddle. He had long since learned how
to work and wait for things he wanted; he could do
it again.</p>
<p>He led the conversation away from the personal.
They talked of nature, each finding under the spur
of companionship many new interests in the old
wood; and being a devoted nature lover, Steve was
pleased to find that Nancy had added to her tender
interest in the feathered folk much information as to
peculiar characteristics of varying species. It was an
easy transition from nature to nature&rsquo;s interpreters,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
the poets, and the two found mutual interest in recalling
some choice things of literature. She had
spent four years at a fine old Kentucky college, graduating
in June with high honours. There was still
a sweet seriousness about her as in the little Nancy
of old, in spite of her girlish gaiety, and while the
years of study had brought her an unmistakable
breadth and culture, there was also a quaint freshness
of speech and manner that made her especially
attractive. Steve found keen satisfaction in the conversation,
for the girl understood his view-point and
yet had fresh conceptions of her own which she knew
how to express.</p>
<p>He said to himself as he studied her (which having
put aside the personal he could now do), &ldquo;She has
the New England alertness of mind inherited from
her mother without the New England reticence, and
from her Kentucky father, eccentric as he is, she gets
the vivacity and charm which is the Kentucky girl&rsquo;s
birthright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet in the midst of his enjoyment an insistent
despair of heart returned as he recalled a certain good
fellowship in her attitude towards Raymond, which
was missing with him. Obtuse as lovers usually are,
it never occurred to him that this was one of the best
of symptoms in his favour!</p>
<p>They had gone in leisurely fashion through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
wood, but the tall trees began to drop away at last,
and they went down the slope till the old mill stood
before them in soft, quaker-gray upon the bank of a
turbulent, rushing mountain creek. The big, wooden
wheel had fallen from its place and the old mill itself
was fast dropping into complete decay, but the trees
in fresh summer green still hung affectionately over
it. Just beyond the mill nestled the gray log cabin
with its porch across the front; and, yes, there was
Tildy pacing back and forth at her spinning-wheel
just as she used to do when Steve and Nancy were
children. She was of the thrifty type of mountain
women, always cleanly, always busy, making the
most of the meagre means at hand. To the young
people it was as though some magic lantern had
flashed before them a scene from the past, and the
two turned involuntarily to one another with a rush
of something tender upon their faces.</p>
<p>Without speaking they rode to the door, and before
Steve could dismount Nancy had sprung from
the saddle, caught up her skirt, and was warmly shaking
hands with the old woman, whom now she did
not often see. Steve quickly followed, and with the
air of an old friend also, put out his hand cordially
to Tildy.</p>
<p>She took it doubtfully, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdye, stranger?&rdquo;</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know me, Mother Greely?&rdquo;
Steve asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shore don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied, pushing her spectacles
up on her nose and peering earnestly through
them. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said finally, &ldquo;I nuver seed ye afore;
leastways I ain&rsquo;t no recollection of hit ef I ever did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, who with the old mill had fallen into
decrepitude, then came slowly hobbling out, an inquiring
look on his kind old face. Tildy turned to
him, raising her voice shrilly, for he heard with difficulty
and asked: &ldquo;Nat, have ye ever seed this
young man afore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the old man returned after searching
scrutiny.</p>
<p>Then Steve said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember an old
gray horse that used to come to the mill with a little
girl in white pinafore on his back, two bags of corn
behind her, and a tousled, brown-haired boy of about
twelve walking beside her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the little girl was always on the verge of
starvation, and only molasses cakes could rescue her,&rdquo;
put in Nancy laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy and Steve,&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman,
and then with the intuition of her sex for romance,
she further exclaimed: &ldquo;An&rsquo; ye hev done got
married!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Steve hastened to say; but the old man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
more accustomed to his wife&rsquo;s shrill voice, caught her
affirmation, and failed to hear Steve&rsquo;s denial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said he, rubbing his hands together,
greatly pleased, &ldquo;Tildy and me allus said ye&rsquo;d marry
some day; ye was jes&rsquo; suited to one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy hated herself for flushing so unreasonably
again, and Steve, not daring to look towards her, was
hurrying to the rescue, when the old woman with a
swift, keen glance at both, broke in with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, pap, no they hain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; piped shrilly into the
old man&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>His face dropped with evident disappointment, and
there was an embarrassed moment for all of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother Greely,&rdquo; said Nancy gaily, determinedly
recovering herself, &ldquo;have you got any of those molasses
cakes you used to give us when we came
over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal now, I think I hev,&rdquo; said the old woman,
rising as quickly as her stiffened limbs would let
her.</p>
<p>Steve looked down at Nancy as Tildy went in,
smiled, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we sit on the door-step, as we used to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy&rsquo;s eyes did not meet his, and she turned her
head to hide that provokingly rising colour as she
sat down in a matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>When they rode away from the mill, having made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the aged couple happy with the renewal of old
times, Steve again with eager yearning strained his
inner vision for a glimpse into her heart, but she
betrayed not the slightest consciousness of the embarrassing
episode.</p>
<p>As the horses went leisurely back along through
the wood, Steve and Nancy talked gently of the two
old people with their wondrous mountain combination
of barest poverty, dense ignorance, keen intelligence,
simple kindliness and gentle dignity,&ndash;&ndash;qualities
which the young folks were now prepared to recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is curious how like two people grow from
constant association,&rdquo; said Steve at last, musingly.
&ldquo;The resemblance between the old miller and his
wife is striking, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; returned Nancy; &ldquo;the shape of face
and type of feature is the same in both, and as for
expression, each might be a mirror for the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be interesting to know which had most
influenced the other,&rdquo; said Steve; &ldquo;whether she has
conformed to his type or he to hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Nat and Tildy certainly furnish a good
opportunity for study of that problem,&rdquo; said Nancy,
&ldquo;for there has been little except the influence of each
upon the other to leave its impress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The subject is an interesting field for the aspiring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
investigator,&rdquo; Steve went on. &ldquo;I wonder that some
fine-spun, scientific theory has not already been
advanced,&ndash;&ndash;but it only remains another formidable
matrimonial hazard,&rdquo; he ended with his sudden
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does indeed,&rdquo; laughed Nancy. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it
be dreadful to think of growing daily more and more
like some people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on the other hand,&rdquo; promptly returned
Steve, &ldquo;how delightful to think of growing more
and more like certain other people,&rdquo; turning to her
with a light in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then there is the uncertainty,&ndash;&ndash;which is most
likely to influence the other,&rdquo; said Nancy, switching
dexterously away from hinted personal application,
and then with a dash of daring gaiety, adding, &ldquo;When
you marry a girl with a crooked nose, will yours
begin to crook likewise, or will hers take on your
symmetrical lines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not going to take one with a crooked
nose,&rdquo; said Steve, smiling significantly in spite of
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but the question remains,&ndash;&ndash;which
is most likely to conform, a husband or a wife,&rdquo; said
Nancy, shying back to the abstract again, with pretty
positiveness. And then she called gaily, as she
touched Gyp with her whip and started both horses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
off on a brisk canter, leaving the wood for the road,
&ldquo;Please let me know if you solve the problem, so I
may be relieved in mind or forewarned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she dashed on slightly ahead of him, spirit and
beauty in every line of pony and rider, Steve said to
himself with a quizzical smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cleverly she manages to keep me at arm&rsquo;s
length. Oh, little Nancy, where did you learn such
tactics?&rdquo; and he did not know that &ldquo;such tactics&rdquo;
were sure forerunners of surrender.</p>
<p>As for Nancy, she stood a little later by her bedroom
window. The trim, smart riding-habit was
laid aside and a little light muslin of almost childlike
simplicity had taken its place. She stood looking
out at nothing through brimming tears, with
flushed cheeks and quivering lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do blush so horridly when I am with him, and
I&rsquo;m afraid I say things I shouldn&rsquo;t. Oh, what makes
me, when I do like him so much!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>&ldquo;ALL RIGHT, SON&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>After dinner Steve walked over to the store
with Mr. Follet, talked with him a little, and
then strolling up the street afterwards, he
was joined with great cordiality by Raymond Colton.</p>
<p>The talk was breezy as was inevitable with Raymond.
He had graduated at a great northern university
in June, had any amount of <i>sang froid</i> and
had as yet caught no glimpse of life save as a field
for pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of Miss Nancy?&rdquo; he inquired
enthusiastically. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she the prettiest thing going?
I have seen them north, south, east, and west,
but I honestly believe I never saw a sweeter flower
growing than Nancy Follet!&rdquo; he went on without
waiting for Steve to answer his question, so a smile
was all the response which seemed necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here,&rdquo; went on Raymond, &ldquo;to look after
a land proposition for father. They say there&rsquo;s lots
of valuable coal and iron ore about here. I&rsquo;ve dipped
a good deal into that sort of thing at college and
father sent me up to make some tests for him, and if
I found anything rich to take up a &lsquo;claim&rsquo; instanter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
I&rsquo;ve been here three weeks and I haven&rsquo;t done a
thing yet. Miss Nancy has fascinated me so, I
haven&rsquo;t had eyes for sordid things. But there&rsquo;s
plenty of time; no danger of anybody&rsquo;s rushing in
ahead in this sleepy little burg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; returned Steve quietly.
&ldquo;You never know when somebody may slip in ahead
of you. Business competition is a very lively thing
I&rsquo;ve been told, though I confess I don&rsquo;t know much
about it,&rdquo; he ended easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been getting a good bit of experience
in business here and there, and I can tell that there&rsquo;s
nobody hanging about here that has much business
go.&rdquo; He had no intention of being personal and
Steve bowed, smiling remotely.</p>
<p>After some more desultory talk they separated and
Steve went back to join Nancy on the porch where
he thought he would find her.</p>
<p>Raymond looked after him with a half smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Steve,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s caught
already, and the worst of it is, I am afraid he&rsquo;s got
the best chance. She&rsquo;s a dear little chum with me,
loves to sing to my tenor and laugh at my foolishness,
but I noticed last night the blushes were for
him.&rdquo; And his handsome face set into unusual, firm
lines as he went on: &ldquo;But I am going to win her!
I&rsquo;ll do it in spite of him. To-night I&rsquo;ll walk off with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
her whether or no, and he&rsquo;ll think his case is lost, for
he doesn&rsquo;t know girls, I can see that.&rdquo; And with
restored confidence he went over to the store to visit
Mr. Follet. He and Mr. Follet were on fine terms,
and he spent an hour or so at the store every day.
They seemed in fact to have some project in common
requiring much consultation.</p>
<p>Evening brought Raymond again to the Follet
porch, and after a little music and general talk, turning
to Mrs. Follet he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother Follet, won&rsquo;t you let us children, Miss
Nancy and me, go for a little walk together? It is
so hard for us to sit still.&rdquo; He said it with mock
childishness that was irresistible, and without waiting
for Mrs. Follet&rsquo;s consent, he laughingly grasped
Nancy&rsquo;s hand and made off with her, whether or no.</p>
<p>Steve could not see the laughing but real protest
in Nancy&rsquo;s face, and his lips set firmly as he watched
her white frock swaying gently up the long, straggling
street.</p>
<p>Mrs. Follet then went in and Mr. Follet, turning
to Steve, began in pleased excitement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raymond&rsquo;s mightily in love with her, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
and went on without waiting for a reply, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
tell about her,&ndash;&ndash;you never can tell nothin&rsquo; about girls,
anyway, you know, and she&rsquo;s just wrapped up in her
piano music. She spends hours thumpin&rsquo; on what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
she calls classical music, but I wouldn&rsquo;t give it for
one tune on the banjo. She&rsquo;s been begging me to
let her go to New York and study, but Lord, she
knows as much now as any woman under the cano<i>pee</i>&rsquo;s
got use for, I think, and I&rsquo;ve told her she can&rsquo;t
do it. Raymond says, though, she ought to go, and
that he&rsquo;d like nothin&rsquo; better than to give her the
chance. His folks have got money, I reckon, and he
can do it all right. If anything&rsquo;ll help to get her
that will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve laughed in reply with as good grace as he
could, and soon followed Mrs. Follet to bed as one
of the &ldquo;old folks&rdquo; before the &ldquo;children&rdquo; returned.</p>
<p>It was evident enough that he did not count with
anybody except the Greelys as a possible suitor for
Nancy, and his sturdy heart chafed in almost bitter
protest. Again sweet memories played truant in the
small attic chamber. &ldquo;And little Nancy has musical
aspirations,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;With the life I have
chosen I could never gratify her. It is absolutely
hopeless for me,&ndash;&ndash;I have nothing to offer her. I am
old and staid, anyway,&rdquo; he said finally to his rebellious
heart. &ldquo;I have known the responsibilities of
life too long, and Nancy is made only for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, putting aside his depression
sternly, Steve went on horseback alone, taking the
same road he and Nancy had taken the morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
before. He lingered again in the Greely woods, this
time on a prospecting tour testing here and testing
there carefully.</p>
<p>When he at last rode up to the little one-roomed
log cabin the old folks again made him welcome.
After chatting a goodly length of time with them,
and getting his voice well pitched for the old man&rsquo;s
hearing, Steve asked if Mr. Greely would not like to
sell off some of his land.</p>
<p>The old man looked surprised at the question, for
no coal fields had then been opened up in that part of
Kentucky, so that he was not aware of the value of
coal bearing land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, course I would, but nobody would want
ter buy hit. Thar&rsquo;s only this patch the cabin and
mill sets on what&rsquo;s any a&rsquo;count, an&rsquo; that I want ter
keep long&rsquo;s me an&rsquo; the ole woman lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you are mistaken about that, Mr.
Greely. I think all that woodland ridge is good
land, and I would like to own it. Will you and
Mrs. Greely think it over, give me a price on it by
to-morrow and let me have the first chance at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Astonished beyond measure the old man looked
helplessly at his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Steve, give me what ye think hit is wuth,
if you really want hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Greely, I must tell you frankly that I cannot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
give what I think it is worth, but I can pay you
more a thousand times than you can ever get out
of it, for you are too old to attempt anything with it,
and there are no children. I think it can be made
to yield returns in ways of which you do not dream
or I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it, but I do not <i>know</i> and I am
making a venture in buying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man thought a minute, then said: &ldquo;Wal,
I know as much now about hit as I will ter-morror
and you can have hit fer a hundred dollars, ef ye kin
pay that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Greely, I can&rsquo;t take it for that,&rdquo; said
Steve smiling; &ldquo;it will be worth much more to me if
it is worth anything. I am willing to venture more
on it,&rdquo; and he named a much larger sum than the
one asked.</p>
<p>The old man could not speak for amazement. He
had never heard of any one in &ldquo;them parts&rdquo; having
so much money at one time and the trade was
practically closed at once.</p>
<p>He left the old folks feeling like millionaires and
felt immense satisfaction himself that the deal had
progressed so well. If the old couple should live in
luxury, as they might conceive the word, for the
rest of their lives, they could never spend that sum
in the mountains.</p>
<p>Steve knew the lay of the land for miles around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
and he felt sure there was nothing so valuable as the
Greely Ridge with the railroad lying not far from its
base.</p>
<p>Asking the Follets if he might leave his traps
there for a few days he went at once in the afternoon
to the county seat to take the necessary steps for the
transfer of the land, and found the title perfectly clear.</p>
<p>With elation over the assured deal and happy
expectation of more than cancelling his debt, he
telegraphed Mr. Polk what he had done. A reply
came promptly back saying, &ldquo;I will be on at once
and bring expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with mingled feelings that Steve thought
of the meeting as he busied himself with the details
completing the transaction, going over with a notary
public for the old folks to sign the papers, getting
everything ready for Mr. Polk&rsquo;s signature as purchaser
since he was coming and one transfer would
be sufficient. He did not stop at the Follets, but
returned at once to meet his old friend.</p>
<p>When Mr. Polk stepped from the train and looked
again upon the boy he had loved as his own, he put
an arm about him, as he used to in the old days, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you,&rdquo; answered Steve, and both
voices trembled a little.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>That was all, but it restored the old frank relations.
They talked with great interest about the purchase
and went as soon as possible with the expert to get
his opinion upon it. When careful tests of the
property had been made, the expert was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it will prove to be a rich coal deposit,
and if well managed ought to bring you a small
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night when they returned to the little
&ldquo;hotel,&rdquo; so named, Mr. Polk and Steve talked long
and interestedly over plans for developing the mine.
Mr. Polk had pretty well-defined ideas for the immediate
organization of a company and the beginning
of operations.</p>
<p>Finally he turned to Steve and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, I have grown since you left,&ndash;&ndash;I hope, some
wiser, and that little woman made me see before I
left home that I had no right to dictate to you what
you should do with your life. I know you have
worked hard these three years, or you never could
have saved money enough to buy this piece of land,
even at so small a price, and I don&rsquo;t doubt you have
done good at the same time. But I still feel that
you might do just as good work perhaps by earning
money for the cause you are so greatly interested in,
so I am going to make a proposition to you. Suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
you take the oversight of this mining business,
handling the money and seeing that everything goes
straight. We could well afford to pay you a good
salary for this service and give you some shares in
the company too. Then you can live right here
and exert your influence upon your people, as you
call them, at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve listened intently, and the thought of money,
and Nancy and music lessons, while he remained in
the mountains, made his brain whirl.</p>
<p>Finally he put out his hand. &ldquo;You hev allus been
kind an&rsquo; generous ter me,&rdquo; he said uncertainly, with
emotion which carried him back for an instant to the
old-time speech. Then lifting his head he smiled
and added, &ldquo;Let me think of this till to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Polk agreed, and they separated for the night.</p>
<p>It was again a time of sore temptation for Steve.
All night he tossed and thought. In spite of recurring
depression he had not given up hope of winning
Nancy. Her desire for musical advantages had been
the most discouraging thing of all, however, and if
he accepted this offer, he could hope to give her what
she wanted, while since Raymond was not accepted
he felt free to win her if he could. He pictured the
future with increasing exhilaration, as the night approached
its zenith, the time of keenest mental activity;
and then, as the ebb came with the waning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
hours, suddenly a little figure reeled and staggered as
it tried to walk a crack in a cabin floor, and springing
from bed Steve strode to the window, and looked
out upon the silent, starry sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep me from temptation;&rdquo;
and after a time he went back to bed firm in the old
resolution that whatever the sacrifice involved, he
would give himself, and not money alone, to the
work. And then he slept.</p>
<p>Next morning he smiled his sudden smile as Mr.
Polk looked keenly into his face, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am incorrigible, Mr. Polk,&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t see
it except in the old way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, son,&rdquo; said Mr. Polk quietly, and when
they separated it was with a warm hand-clasp as Mr.
Polk exacted a promise that Steve would visit them
his first opportunity. &ldquo;&lsquo;The little mother&rsquo; longs to
see her boy,&rdquo; he said affectionately; then added,
&ldquo;Some day we hope to be in shape to help you with
your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was gone Steve left for the Follets again.
A great peace had come upon him with the renewal
of his resolution, and his heart leaped at the prospect
of seeing Nancy again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long it seems since I left her,&rdquo; he laughed
to himself, and the thought sprang to his mind from
out the ever active realm of human hope: &ldquo;Perhaps
I shall win her yet by some miracle!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XV</h2>
<h3>FLICKERING HOPE</h3>
</div>
<p>It was with keen satisfaction that Steve caught a
glimpse of Nancy&rsquo;s white dress out under the
trees upon his return to the Follets. He hurried
over to the bench where she sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything more satisfying than these
Kentucky mountains?&rdquo; he said, with enthusiasm, as
he seated himself beside her. &ldquo;There is something
that constantly assures me I belong to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wondered that you were not captured by
the city with all its allurements,&rdquo; said Nancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Steve, &ldquo;though perhaps I might
have been at first had not my little foster-mother
been loyal to Kentucky mountain need. But my experience
the past three years as teacher has made it
impossible for me to ever get away from the outstretched
hand of Kentucky mountain children,&rdquo; and
his voice dropped into deep earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand how you feel,&rdquo; said Nancy after
a little silence. &ldquo;I could not help being interested
in the school when it was opened here. Little children
came trudging in from the most barren cabin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
homes, wide-eyed, and eager to &lsquo;larn,&rsquo; and grown-up
men and women tramped barefoot miles and miles
every day to try to get some of the &lsquo;larnin&rsquo; they&rsquo;d
heard about. Then they would plod away with the
utmost patience trying to read and write. It was intensely
pathetic. Nothing has ever touched and interested
me so much as some supply work I have
done for our school,&rdquo; she added, a light upon her
face, which thrilled Steve&rsquo;s heart anew. What a help
she could be to him in his chosen work!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you have felt the appeal of mountain
need,&rdquo; said he, struggling to keep the thrill out of his
voice. And then he told her of his hopes and plans,
of the dream he had of a new school within reach of
Hollow Hut, a region to which new possibilities were
about to come, he had learned at the county seat,
through a projected railroad line. Of how he hoped
to have help in the work from Mr. and Mrs. Polk and
perhaps other capitalists of the north, and she was
most interested, most appreciative, showing all the
sweet seriousness of little Nancy of old.</p>
<p>But this long talk of some two hours which revealed
again congenial tastes and ideals of life for the
two only served to make Steve&rsquo;s heart more intensely
rebellious when, after supper, Raymond walked in
once more with his debonair proprietorship of Nancy.
As it happened she had just stepped out under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
trees to get a bit of fancy work left there in the afternoon,
and Raymond joining her, barricaded the way
to the house, insisting that the &ldquo;old folks&rdquo; were glad
to get rid of them, till she laughingly sat with him
there. It had been purely accidental, her going out
just then, and she remained with inward protest, but
Steve could only see in it complete surrender to the
ardent suitor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Follet had not yet come out and Mr. Follet
turned to Steve, laughing in a pleased way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, for I know you are interested,&rdquo;
he said confidentially, &ldquo;that Raymond
told me this morning he was simply crazy about her,
he couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer, and was going to pop
the question to-night. I s&rsquo;pose there ain&rsquo;t much
question about it though, for I reckon she&rsquo;s as much
in love as he, though,&ndash;&ndash;as I said, you never can
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he little suspected that what he said seemed
to Steve the death-knell to his hopes.</p>
<p>Mr. Follet continued loquaciously: &ldquo;Raymond&rsquo;s
the greatest fellow I ever saw. Everybody likes
him. Why, he&rsquo;s in with the moonshiners about here
hand and glove, and they&rsquo;re powerful offish. Never
saw anything under the cano<i>pee</i> like him. He has
big plans too, about some of the land round here
which he says is full of coal. He&rsquo;s looked a little at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
the Greely Ridge; he thinks that&rsquo;s the finest piece,
but he hasn&rsquo;t been over it carefully yet&ndash;&ndash;been too
much in love, you know,&rdquo; and he laughed contentedly.</p>
<p>Steve made conventional reply, and admitting he
was quite tired, went to the little attic for another
restless, unhappy night.</p>
<p>If the good fairies had only visited his couch and
whispered their story of what was going on under the
trees, how sweet would have been his sleep! But
they did not.</p>
<p>Next morning Steve announced at the breakfast
table that he must be leaving the following morning;
a few days off from work for pleasure was all he
could take with good grace.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Follet expressed their regret, while
Nancy&rsquo;s eyes were upon her plate. Mr. Follet was
complaining of some sciatic pain, but tried to throw
it off with his usual nervous energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t taken Steve over
to Borden&rsquo;s Cave, which has been discovered since
he was here. Why don&rsquo;t you go this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I should be glad to,&rdquo; responded Nancy,
and Steve, feeling that her agreement was upon the
basis of the old family relationship between them,
made no excuse, though he did not doubt, with the
fatality of anxious lovers, that the engagement had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
taken place. The two started off with Gyp and the
family horse for a three mile canter, and Steve&rsquo;s
spirit rose with the exhilaration of it in spite of himself.</p>
<p>The cave proved to be a most interesting rock
formation and when they had examined it, Steve
pointing out some curious scientific facts, they sat
down in the quiet woods upon a fallen tree trunk,
while the horses grazed.</p>
<p>Nancy looked up at him when they were seated,
and said naively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much you have learned in these last busy
years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; said Steve, his eyes brightening. &ldquo;I
am especially glad you think I have used my time
well, because I can never forget that it was you who
taught me my letters,&ndash;&ndash;even how to spell my name,&rdquo;
and he turned kindling eyes upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; she said, laughing and flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he returned, and a bit of tenderness crept
into his voice. &ldquo;I will never forget how you did it,
how picturesquely you characterized the various
letters for me, how you thought curly S the very
prettiest letter in the alphabet, and how disappointed
I was when I found my poor name did not hold a
single letter which belonged to yours,&rdquo; and there was
such deep pathos in the last words, as he looked far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
into the distance, that she stirred uneasily and could
make no answer.</p>
<p>After a moment he went on: &ldquo;I suppose I read
in it, even then, a prophecy of our future, how yours
must be separate from mine. There could be nothing
in common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And still she was dumb; not a word came to her
lips. But he seemed to need no reply; a sad
meditativeness was stealing upon him which made
him oblivious for the moment of his surroundings.</p>
<p>But suddenly setting his lips firmly, he turned and
said with forced lightness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bear bachelorhood makes of a man! I
have spent so much time alone the last few years
that I am already acquiring the bad habit of thinking
my thoughts aloud sometimes. Forgive me, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; And he turned to her with more in the tone
than the simple words could convey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to forgive,&rdquo; said she, but with an
effort,&ndash;&ndash;which he misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Then gathering her wits she repeated, &ldquo;I have
nothing to forgive, but everything for which to
thank you. My starting you in the life intellectual
cannot compare with your finding me hanging by a
mere thread from a tall tree top and restoring me to
the life physical, without which my brilliant intellectual
attainments would have been as nothing,&rdquo; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
ended gaily, breaking the tension which both had
felt.</p>
<p>The talk continued to drift near the sacred realm
of the heart, however, until the sanctity of engagement
was finally touched upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An engagement is to me a very sacred thing,&rdquo;
said Nancy with sweet seriousness, in response to
something from Steve. &ldquo;I have never understood
how it could be lightly entered into with only the
basis of a brief, gay acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was not that just what she had done? &ldquo;Oh, consistency,
thy name is certainly not woman,&rdquo; thought
Steve bitterly. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that is good theory, but it is generally
overwhelmed by practice when a gay cavalier comes
along and takes the maiden heart by storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so, with some,&rdquo; returned Nancy quietly,
&ldquo;but so far as I am concerned I do not believe I
could be deceived into thinking that a brief, gay acquaintance
was sufficient assurance for the binding
of two in the tenderest tie of life, when their tastes
and ideals might prove to be totally at variance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s heart leaped within him. Was she trying
to tell him something,&ndash;&ndash;to undeceive him with regard
to Raymond and herself? Impetuous words rose
and trembled on his lips, while the thought raced
through his brain that it would not be dishonourable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
to ask if there were the least hope for him. He
would not utter another word if she said the sacred
tie was already entered into with Raymond.</p>
<p>But Nancy, in the yielding and yet withdrawing
which is characteristic of woman and man never fully
understands, plunged into a new topic. Frightened
at the plainness of her revelation and almost seeming
to divine his purpose, with her brightest talk she led
him far afield.</p>
<p>Steve, however, baffled though he was, found
memory of that shy look coming back to him insistently,
till he suddenly, firmly determined as they
rode home once more that Nancy Follet should have
the opportunity of accepting or refusing him before
he left the place!</p>

<h3>IN THE CRUCIBLE</h3>
</div>
<p>When Steve and Nancy reached home
they found Mr. Follet in bed suffering intensely
with sciatic pains. He fretted constantly,
declaring he would get up whether or no by
afternoon. He was obliged to make a trip into the
country for a load of hay, able or not, that evening,
he said. Steve offered to go for him, but Mr. Follet
impatiently declared that nobody could do it but
himself, as there was some other business to be attended
to at the same time.</p>
<p>The pain continued so severe, however, that
getting up was an impossibility, and about seven
o&rsquo;clock after fretting and fuming for hours, occupying
Mrs. Follet and Nancy continually, he said to
his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go tell Steve to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Follet obeyed and brought Steve in from
the porch where he sat supposedly reading, Nancy
being busy then with the supper dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you go out, ma, and don&rsquo;t come back till I
tell you,&rdquo; said Mr. Follet querulously, and his wife
went wonderingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Steve,&rdquo; said Mr. Follet as soon as the young
man entered, &ldquo;I know I can trust you, and I am
going to get you to do some important business for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will certainly do anything for you, Mr. Follet,
with great pleasure, and I appreciate more than I
can tell you the fact that you feel you can trust me,&rdquo;
said Steve warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Follet, a little uneasily, &ldquo;this is
mighty partic&rsquo;ler business I&rsquo;ve got. The fact is,&rdquo; he
went on with nervous energy, &ldquo;a part of the world
is getting so good it ain&rsquo;t content with just being
good itself but is bound and determined that the rest
of the world shall do just as it says, and there&rsquo;s a
good bit of difference of opinion about what goodness
strictly is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve listened a little surprised at the homily.
Then Mr. Follet went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t ever cared anything about liquor myself,
though I could have had all I wanted all my life long,
but I am willing other people should make it, and
have it, or sell it, all they want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve looked more surprised and his lips settled
just a little into firmer lines, but Mr. Follet failed to
notice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, old Kaintuck, which has always been the
freest state in the Union, has got a passle o&rsquo; folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
turned loose in it just like the folks I was telling you
about. They&rsquo;re so good themselves they ain&rsquo;t satisfied
till they make everybody else do just as they
say. They&rsquo;re making laws in the towns that no
liquor can be sold, and I tell you men of old Kaintuck
ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stand that and I don&rsquo;t blame &rsquo;em,&rdquo;
he concluded vehemently.</p>
<p>Steve started to reply, his lips growing firmer, and
his eyes taking fire, but Mr. Follet gave him no
chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I promised some fellows that I would meet
&rsquo;em to-night,&ndash;&ndash;and bring home a load of hay,&rdquo; he
ended with an excited laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A load of hay with whiskey enclosed?&rdquo; asked
Steve, instantly suspecting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Follet, delighted with Steve&rsquo;s
quickness, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the idee. Then I unload it in my
barn and ship it as I please to these dry towns.
I&rsquo;m in for the law as a general thing,&rdquo; he added
quickly, &ldquo;but I believe in folks having their rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Follet,&rdquo; said Steve, going to the foot
of the bed and leaning hard upon it, &ldquo;we must
understand each other at once. I do not agree with
you as to our rights. I do not think we have the
right to destroy ourselves or others with any weapon
whatsoever, the pistol, the knife, poison or whiskey.
I am with the law in every particular,&rdquo; he said firmly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;With the law,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Follet excitedly,
&ldquo;when it says a man can&rsquo;t do with his own corn on
his own place what he wants to do with it? A
man&rsquo;s got as good a right, in my mind, to put up a
still and make whiskey out of his corn as his wife
has to gather apples and make pies!&rdquo; he concluded,
fairly quivering with excitement.</p>
<p>Steve held himself quietly, and said gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Follet, you are too ill for me to discuss these
things with you now. I see we look at them from
totally different points of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t but one point of view,&rdquo; shrilly returned
Mr. Follet, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the point of view of
man&rsquo;s rights. Why, it won&rsquo;t be long till a man can&rsquo;t
milk his own cow without the government standing
round to watch her switch her tail and tell him how
to do it,&ndash;&ndash;all ready to grab the money if he sells a
little to a neighbour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Follet,&rdquo; said Steve, looking steadily
but kindly in the enraged eyes of his opponent,
&ldquo;there is one thing that we do agree upon, and that
is, every man has a right to his own opinion,&rdquo; and
the kindness in Steve&rsquo;s eyes merged into his sudden
smile, which stemmed a little the rising tide of Mr.
Follet&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>After a somewhat subdued pause he turned to
Steve appealingly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But you will go and get this load for me,&ndash;&ndash;you
will have no responsibility about it. I have never
had anything to do with moonshiners before,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;but Raymond got in with &rsquo;em and thinks it
would be a huge joke to send a lot of their whiskey
to his friends in these &lsquo;dry towns,&rsquo; and that prohibition
business has riled me so that I promised I would
help pass the stuff along. Raymond&rsquo;s going to hang
around the saloon and the station to see that the
coast is clear o&rsquo; government men, while the thing is
goin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Steve instantly and firmly when Mr.
Follet was through, &ldquo;I cannot do it, Mr. Follet,
greatly as it grieves me to refuse you a favour. I
feel that whiskey, the knife and the pistol have been
Kentucky&rsquo;s greatest curses, especially among the
people of the mountains. I would lay down my life,
if necessary, for mountain folks, but I long instead
to spend it for them in replacing the pistol and the
knife with the book and the pen, and in cultivating
among them a thirst for knowledge instead of drink,&rdquo;
said Steve with quiet passion which held Mr. Follet&rsquo;s
unwilling attention. Then he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand me, Mr. Follet, I do not attempt to
decide for you what is right or wrong, I only know
that I cannot do this thing you ask and keep my
self-respect. I must live within the laws of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
country even if I should feel sometimes that they are
unjust, and I can never take even a remote part in
the distribution of whiskey in the land I love,&rdquo; he
concluded earnestly.</p>
<p>At this Mr. Follet fairly shouted in a sudden access
of rage. He was all the more angry for the moment
because in the light of Steve&rsquo;s clear statement he not
only felt that Steve was right, but that he himself
was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave my house this instant with your contemptible
idees about Kentucky&rsquo;s rights, and don&rsquo;t
dare to stop and speak to my wife or my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your house, Mr. Follet; I will do just as
you say,&rdquo; Steve replied.</p>
<p>Mr. Follet reiterated shrilly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on out of my house then, and don&rsquo;t you ever
come near it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve bowed and left, not even stopping to get his
travelling bag; in fact he forgot he had one, and
only caught up his hat from the porch as he passed
out.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>FRUITION</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Follet and Nancy knew that something
very exciting was going on between
Mr. Follet and Steve and both were exceedingly
anxious. When silence took the place of
heated discussion they could bear it no longer and
went to Mr. Follet&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Mrs. Follet had never seen her husband so wrought
up before, though he had always been of an exciteable
temperament. She did not dare ask a question,
but busied herself doing little things for his comfort
while Nancy brought in his supper, which he had
not wanted earlier and still querulously refused to
touch.</p>
<p>A terrible silence settled upon them all. Nancy sat
on the porch in distressed wonder over what had
happened between her father and Steve, while Mrs.
Follet, equally anxious, sat silently by the bed of the
restless man. She proposed to get a neighbour to
go for the doctor, but Mr. Follet wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.
Hours passed by and then Mr. Follet suddenly started
up in bed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he cried wildly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried his wife, starting up also, while
Nancy&rsquo;s white face at once appeared in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Steve,&rdquo; screamed Mr. Follet. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,
and I don&rsquo;t doubt he went straight to old man Greely&rsquo;s
for the night. If he did, he&rsquo;s cut across the woods
and run into some moonshiners. They&rsquo;ll take him
for a government man and shoot him soon&rsquo;s they lay
eyes on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for breath, and Mrs. Follet and Nancy
were too appalled to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do something,&rdquo; screamed Mr. Follet; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
have the boy&rsquo;s blood on my hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Follet with her gentle strength made him
quiet down enough to tell them particulars, and she
learned that Mr. Follet was to have gone after a load
of hay, and coming back would stop at the edge of
the wood leading to old man Greely&rsquo;s, walk into the
woods a piece to meet the men, and then, if the coast
was clear, they&rsquo;d hide the liquor in the hay load. At
the end she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go, Nancy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Mr. Follet, &ldquo;you must go, child, and
save Steve. Jim Sutton will know you. They won&rsquo;t
touch you, and they&rsquo;ll believe you. I was a fool
ever to have anything to do with that moonshine
business!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>But Nancy was already out of the room flying for
the stable. There was no thought of riding habit or
saddle. Throwing a bridle over Gyp&rsquo;s head, she
sprang upon his back and like the wind the two
rushed forth into the midnight stillness. Would she
be in time to save him? It had been so long since
he left the house. Oh, would she be too late? She
urged Gyp wildly on and on, along the road directly
towards the Greely woods, where she would find the
moonshiners, and perhaps,&ndash;&ndash;oh, perhaps! God only
knew what else she might find.</p>
<p>Every throbbing pulse beat became a prayer that
she might be in time to save him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meanwhile Steve, upon leaving Mr. Follet, had not
gone out into the street, but crossing the lawn into
the driveway he went past the stable to the wood
back of the house from whence he had come so many
years ago. His mind and heart were in a tumult.
He scarcely thought where he was going till he suddenly
became conscious that he was in the old wood
where he had rescued Nancy so long ago. Little
Nancy! And he had loved her ever since consciously
or unconsciously. But she was completely lost to
him now,&ndash;&ndash;that was final. The fair dream-structure
which had risen anew that afternoon had fallen again
in a tragic moment&rsquo;s space. The mountain blood in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
Mr. Follet would never forget or forgive. He must
leave the place forever. He was adrift again in the
world. There would never be tender home ties for
him,&ndash;&ndash;he could never love another, no one could be
a part of his very self like little Nancy. He dropped
down upon a little seat which he had fixed there for
her in the old days, and was lost in depressed thought,
taking no note of how long he remained.</p>
<p>The stillness of the wood quieted him finally, as it
had always done, and he remembered his old friends
the Greelys. They would be glad to have him come
in for breakfast in the morning, and for the night he
would sleep in the Greely woods. He would feel
very near to Nancy there, for that spot was hallowed
by her memory as no other for him. He rose and
made his way over into the road which led to the
wood.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant moonlight night, and he walked
on under the majestic beauty of the firmament with
quieted spirit.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he had almost reached the wood, he
heard rapid hoof-beats behind him and paused to listen,
for it was a little-travelled road. Nearer and
nearer they came, and then he could distinguish a
white dress fluttering in the wind from the flying animal&rsquo;s
back and knew the rider must be a woman.
The speed of the horse began to slacken as she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
almost upon him, and he saw that it was Gyp and
Nancy!</p>
<p>She also had recognized him, and the next instant
she sprang from the pony and stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Steve,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;they will kill you!&rdquo;
and stretched her shaking hands out to him. Her
agitation was pitiable. Unconsciously he drew her
instantly within his arms, while he said with equal
unconsciousness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Nancy, darling, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer she dropped her head upon his breast
and sobbed convulsively.</p>
<p>He held her close, stroking her face and soothing
her with tenderest words of love till she was able to
speak again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moonshiners that father was to meet, Steve,&ndash;&ndash;they
are in the Greely wood, and they will think
you are a revenue man and kill you sure,&rdquo; she said
brokenly. &ldquo;You were going there, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father thought you would and sent me for you.
Oh, it was dreadful, the terror of it,&rdquo; she said shuddering
and sobbing anew.</p>
<p>Again he soothed her with caresses and whispered,
&ldquo;But, sweetheart, you know I am not going there
now,&ndash;&ndash;not when I can hold you like this.&rdquo; And she
nestled in his arms at last in quiet happiness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>Finally she lifted her head and smiled up at him.
He turned her face up to the moon&rsquo;s full light and
looked longingly into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy, do you love me?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Steve, I&rsquo;ve always loved you, I think,&rdquo; she
softly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it never was Raymond?&rdquo; he went on insistently,
his voice taking on a resonant ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; she returned. Then smiling
demurely at him she said, &ldquo;Oh, Steve, you weren&rsquo;t
nearly so stupid in learning your letters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he punished her with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember,&rdquo; he said at last tenderly,
looking over at the Greely wood, &ldquo;that you asked
me when a little girl to build a house for you and
me over there where we might live always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said with a touch of sweet reluctance,
&ldquo;I confess I have always remembered that childish
speech,&ndash;&ndash;with an intuitive knowledge that I shouldn&rsquo;t
have made it, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I have always treasured it consciously or
unconsciously,&rdquo; he returned, with eager joy creeping
into the tenderness of his voice. &ldquo;You were a
blessed little prophetess, for it is here under the
shadow of the old wood that love has at last built
for us the fairest, holiest structure earth ever knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they remembered the hour of the night and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the anxiety of her father and mother, and started
back down the road, Nancy saying she would like to
walk a little and Steve leading Gyp, who had been
unconcernedly grazing by the roadside.</p>
<p>After a time the lover went on again joyously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have equal right to one another now, have
we not, sweetheart, for if I saved you from possible
death at the moment of our meeting, you have probably
saved me from a tragic end to-night. It is the
way of our mountain life,&rdquo; he added, his voice taking
on a note of sadness; &ldquo;our joy must always be
mingled with tragedy until we learn the beautiful
ways of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he stopped again and turned her face up to
the moonlight once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be content, dearest, to help me in the
work I have chosen,&ndash;&ndash;it will probably mean sacrifice,&ndash;&ndash;the
giving up of your ambitions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled back with a low, &ldquo;More than content,
if I may be always with you.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The next day Steve met Raymond on the street,
and the latter was more serious than Steve had ever
seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old fellow,&rdquo; he said with an attempt at a
smile, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve licked me again. I know all about
the sale of Greely Ridge and your narrow escape last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
night. Those two things, I admit, show me I am a
good deal of a fool, and something of a cad as I used
to be. I want you to know that the business with
the moonshiners is all off. The other victory you&rsquo;ve
won over me I can&rsquo;t talk about. I acknowledge you
deserve her though, more than I do, and I wish you
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Steve could reply he went on: &ldquo;You got
some hard knocks when you were a boy, Steve, and
they did you good. That is when we need them
most. These are the first real blows I have ever had.
I&rsquo;ve always been in for a good time and had it, but I
don&rsquo;t believe it pays. Father is going to be no end
put out with me about the loss of that coal land.
I&rsquo;m going home and make a clean breast of it,&ndash;&ndash;then
I am going to clear out. I&rsquo;ve decided this morning
to write Mr. Polk and see if he has any chance for me
there. I know he will give it to me, if he has, for
father&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just the thing,&rdquo; said Steve heartily. &ldquo;I
feel sure he can take you in, and the game of business
is so interesting there, I know you will like it,
and I believe you will make good.&rdquo; He extended
his hand with the last words and Raymond took it
with a warm clasp.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Mr. Polk&rsquo;s mine was promptly opened up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
proved to be a valuable property. In the formation
of his company some shares had been placed in the
name of Stephen Langly. At the end of two years
they began to yield good returns and Steve felt that
this, with the income from his work, would make
comfort assured for Nancy. Then came a wedding
in the Follet home, and just before the company arrived
for the ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Polk, her eyes
shining as of old, slipped into the little parlour and
placed on the carpet, for the bride and groom to
stand upon, a beautiful fox-skin rug with a history.</p>
<p>Mr. Follet coming in a moment later nudged his
wife excitedly and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell where under the cano<i>pee</i> you ever
saw that before?&rdquo; while she nodded smiling assent.</p>
<p>It caught the eye of Steve as he entered with
Nancy on his arm, and he took his place upon it
with firm, glad step.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Polk were obliged to hurry away as
soon as the congratulations were over, in order to
get back to New York in time for the wedding of
Raymond and Nita Trowbridge,&ndash;&ndash;Raymond having
well fulfilled Steve&rsquo;s prophecy of making good.</p>
<p>In the fall four years later when the mountains
glowed with unusually brilliant colour, as though
nature had caught the glory tints of fresh, bright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
hope for her people, Steve and Nancy opened a new
school. Its well-equipped, modern buildings crowned
the old wooded mountain of Steve&rsquo;s boyhood, and
Steve the second, a sturdy boy, came daily with little
Champ to school. The &ldquo;still&rdquo; had passed away
with the passing of Champ, the elder, in a mountain
fight, and a new day had dawned for Hollow Hut.</p>
